<p><span class="smcap">We</span> beseech all our youthful readers <em>not</em> to pass by
our Christmas chapter.</p>

<p>We wish we possessed an abler pen, that would induce
every family in the land, rich or poor, to celebrate the
birth of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who gave his life for
us. Even if some learned men think the twenty-fifth of
December is not the day Christ was born, what does it
concern us? We know Christ brought love and charity
into the world, therefore in gratitude we should celebrate
his birth; the exact period is of but little consequence.</p>

<p>Seldon informs us that the Christian church, desirous
of abolishing the Saturnalia of the Romans, a festival
instituted in honor of Saturn, appointed a festival in
honor of her Divine Master, Jesus Christ, to supersede
it. But the observance of the day did not become general
until about the year 500. The reason why the
evening before Christmas day is celebrated, is, that in the
primitive church the day was always observed as the
Sabbath, and like it, preceded by an eve, or vigil. It
was once believed that if we were to go into a cow-house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
at twelve o’clock, on the night before Christmas, all the
cattle would be found kneeling. Many firmly believe the
bees sing in their hives Christmas Eve, to welcome the
approaching day.</p>

<p>We deck our houses and churches with evergreen, because
at this sacred time the earth, then wrapped in darkness,
was, as it were, clothed in living green by the birth
of Jesus Christ, our Saviour; fit emblems are they,
of the never-dying spirit of our Lord and Master.</p>

<p>The laurel is used with other evergreens at Christmas,
because of its use among the ancient Romans, as the
emblem of peace, joy, and victory. In the Christian
sense it may be applied to the victory gained over the
powers of evil by the coming of Christ. The mistletoe
is used in all Christmas decorations by the English. Its
berries and its green are very beautiful. It is a parasitic
plant, and grows on the oak tree. A branch of
mistletoe is often hung over a door-way on Christmas
Eve, and if a gentleman can kiss a lady as she passes
under the mistletoe, he has on <em>that</em> evening a right to the
privilege.</p>

<p>The evergreens mostly used in America are hemlock,
spruce, laurel, and the varieties of ground pine. The
bright red bitter sweet berries gathered in the fall add
to the beauty of the wreaths.</p>

<p>Many have asked the meaning of initials affixed to
crosses on that day, such as I. H. C., and I. H. S. The
former stands for three Latin words: “Jesus Humanitatis
Consolator”—Jesus the Consoler of mankind;
the latter, “Jesus Hominum Salvator”—Jesus the Saviour
of Men. On some very ancient crosses are found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
I. N. R. I., “Jesus Nazarenus, Rex Judæorum”—Jesus
of Nazareth, King of the Jews.</p>

<p>“Yule” was a name anciently given to Christmas, and
it was the custom to select a large log to burn on Christmas
Eve, for in those days the old-fashioned fireplaces
would hold very large logs of wood. The festivities of
that night lasted until the log burned out. This log was
called the “Yule log.”</p>

<p>The Scandinavians watched the declining rays of the
sun from early spring even to December, with great anxiety,
and erected slanting dolmens to detect the first
certainty of its approaching return; and when informed
that its face was once more turned towards their habitations,
over which their enemy, the snow, had already
usurped his authority, they brought the “Yule log” to
the fire, and danced, and sung, and shouted, and drank,
the grand carouse of all the year, making the frozen
air jubilant with their Christmas carols under the
mistletoe.</p>

<p>Our Pilgrim Fathers had suffered so much persecution
from the Church of England, that they abolished all
church festivities. Their persecutions made them austere
in all things. They looked upon church festivals as devices
of the evil spirits, forgetting that He who gave us
the bright sun, lovely flowers, and sparkling streams,
rejoices to see man cheerful as well as good.</p>

<p>Our Pilgrim Fathers suffered much for our good, and
now our noble free country can afford to have many festivals.</p>

<p>The celebration of Christmas is fast winning its way,
even in New England. The beautiful custom of decorating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
our homes and our churches yearly increases throughout
the land. What can be more appropriate than to
celebrate the birthday of our Saviour with garlands and
songs, and the affectionate interchange of gifts.</p>

<p>God gave us his only begotten Son; we in humble
imitation give gifts to our loved ones. God’s deeds
seem consistent with this day. He, whose birth we celebrate,
gave his life for us. Can we restrain our hands
from relieving, our hearts from sympathizing with the
poor, the bereaved, and the distressed?</p>

<p>The custom of giving presents at Christmas originated
in Germany. It was derived from the ancient feast of
Sol. The children of many Americans, who remember
Christmas, hang up their stockings Christmas Eve, thinking
“Santa Claus” will come in the night and fill them
with gifts. Some, to avoid being roused at too early
an hour, have taken a large bag, as a receptacle for presents,
and the father or mother of the family in due time
distribute the presents. Others have had a table spread
with their gifts of love, or place their gifts carefully
under the breakfast plates, or on the chairs at the table.
But the German custom of Christmas trees is by far the
most desirable. We wish it was universal here. The
writer of this assisted in preparing almost the first tree
in our portion of New England, but since then the Christmas
tree has spread far and wide; a tree more productive
of pleasure and fun was never before planted.</p>

<p>We will give some simple directions for the arrangement
of the Christmas tree, hoping to induce some families,
who have felt a Christmas tree was too expensive, to
plant it this year. This tree is within the means of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
poor as well as the rich, by the exercise of the united
skill of any family.</p>

<p>We think all such festivals and family meetings assist
in making “the home” the dearest spot on earth.</p>


<h3>1.—HOW TO MAKE A CHRISTMAS TREE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first thing to be considered is how to obtain a
suitable tree.</p>

<p>If you are not near any woods, and intend to purchase
an evergreen from a nursery of trees, the “silver fir”
is decidedly the best adapted for that purpose. In the
large cities, trees of all kinds can be easily bought; they
are carried through the streets for sale. If you go to
the woods, the common spruce is the most suitable.
The hemlock is the prettiest green, but its boughs are
not sufficiently firm to bear any considerable weight.
If a spruce cannot be found, hemlock can be used by
nailing narrow slats of wood across the tree and under
the branches, as a support. Paint the slats green, and
they do not show; in that way candles and presents can
be firmly fastened to its branches.</p>

<p>If the tree is not perfect in shape, nail on here and
there an extra branch, until it becomes symmetrical.</p>

<p>Take a small round tub, or half of a small cask.
Place your tree in the centre and brace it firmly, and fill
the cask with sand. Cover the cask with green moss; it
is the prettiest green for the purpose. It can be covered
with little branches of hemlock if moss cannot be procured,
or even a green floor mat can be placed around it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Another simple way to fasten a tree firmly, is to take a
suitable block of wood, and have a hole made in the centre
just to fit the stem of the tree, and cover the block
with moss, or paint it. Then place your tree either in
the centre or corner of your room where it is to be, first
spreading a white cloth over the floor, which will not
only protect your carpet, but add to the brilliancy of your
tree when it is lighted. Some use a small tree, and
place it in the centre of a table; the presents too large
and heavy for the tree, are placed upon the table. When
your tree is firmly placed in the right position, fasten on
your candles with little tins, cut in the form of a diamond,
with two very acute angles, and bent in the centre
to form a right angle; push one point into your tree, and
on the other fasten your candle or taper. The latter is
the prettiest, and neatest to use. Buy the colored wax
tapers. If you prefer you can cut up candles. Tapers
or candles can be fastened also to your trees by wires, or
by melting one end of the candle, and while hot, fasten
it by the melted wax to the branch of the tree. Also
you can purchase tins prepared to hold the tapers, made
with a sharp point to fasten to the tree, and one to put
in the taper; that point must be heated before fastening
it to the candle. This tin has a hollow rim around it to
catch the melted wax.</p>

<p>Trees can be lighted with gas, by unscrewing the centre
gas chandelier, and fastening on a gas pipe reaching to
the floor, with branches or arms of different lengths,
according to the size of the tree, longer at the bottom,
shorter at the top. Fasten your tree firmly close to the
centre pipe; the branches of the tree should hide it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
The branches of the gas-pipe should be wound with gold
or green paper, and the branches of the tree placed, if
possible, over them. This makes a brilliant tree, and is
much easier to light, and does not require to be constantly
watched. But wax tapers are more appropriate.</p>

<p>When your tree is firmly fastened and the lights all
arranged, hang on your ornaments with wires and ribbons,
commencing with the top of the tree first.</p>

<p>We will give a few simple directions for making ornaments,
which may be useful to those who cannot afford
to purchase.</p>

<p>To form gilded balls, take nuts, such as walnuts, filberts,
and English walnuts (the latter nut can be opened
and filled with anything you please, and then glued together
again). Fasten a long tack or nail into the end
of the walnut to hold it by, and afterwards to suspend to
the tree. Wash the nut all over with the white of an
egg, laid on with a feather. Then roll it in leaf gold till
it is well covered. Be careful you do not breathe over
the leaf gold, or it will fly away from you. A cheaper
way is to take a sheet of gold paper, and cut a piece
sufficiently large to cover the nut. Brush it with paste,
then fasten it round the nut, rolling it over and over in
your hand, to fill in every crevice. Apples covered with
gold paper look very tempting; a smooth-skinned apple,
of medium size, can be used, and the gold paper should
be cut in sections, so that it will fit the apple smoothly.</p>

<p>Pretty little ornamental bags can be made of English
walnuts. After the shells are well cleaned, varnish and
paint or gild them in stripes, then bore holes in each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
half shell at the top and bottom, and fasten them together
with narrow ribbon. Another prettier way is to
take pieces of colored silk or ribbon, and fasten together
at the side, then take half of one side of a nut, and glue
the silk firmly all around the inside edge; hem the top
of the silk and run in a string, or simply take strong
saddlers’ silk and run all around, to draw it up. Thus
is formed a pretty bag, which can be filled with candy;
lace bags, filled with candy and parched corn, are ornamental.
Take oblong pieces of coarse lace, run into the
meshes bright colored worsted, then fasten them into a
bag firm with the same worsted, and draw them up
at the top with worsted. Birds’ nests add to the
attraction of the tree. Take some halves of unboiled
egg-shells; dip them in white of egg (but first you must
have some moss ready), make a hollow of moss in your
hand, and put the half shell in it. The moss will adhere
to the outside. Take care that your moss be thick
enough to hide the white of the shell. Line the inside
with down or cotton wool, and put sugar-plum eggs in it.
These nests look charming in the dark foliage of a tree.
Small flags are a great addition; we would suggest that
flags made to represent the national banner of other nations
would be pleasant work for both boys and girls,
illustrations of all of which can be found in any large
atlas.</p>

<p>For horns of candy, get some white cartridge paper,
cut squares, ornament them with pictures, mottoes, gold,
silver, and fancy paper; shape them into a horn, and
paste them firmly; cut off the top point and bind the
rim with paper or ribbon, also paste on a loop of ribbon
to fasten to the tree, and fill them with candy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>Glittering crystals, made of alum, are very pretty.
To make them, dissolve alum in hot water until it will
hold no more, then strain it off. Then take bonnet wire
and form little baskets, sprays of leaves, little wreaths,
or make the wreaths of tiny sprigs of spruce, fir, or take
raisin stems (a slightly rough surface is necessary), suspend
these by a network of string tied across the top of
a deep basket; the dissolved alum must cover each article
entirely; let them remain undisturbed over night.
Remove them carefully the next morning, and you will
find them glittering with minute crystals, resembling diamonds.
If powdered turmeric is added to the hot alum
solution, the crystals will be bright yellow. Litmus
will cause them to be of a bright red. Logwood will
turn them purple. The more muddy the solution the
finer will be the crystals.</p>

<p>Sprays of mock coral, also tiny baskets of the same
material, add to the tree’s beauty. To make them, take
bright red sealing-wax, powder it, and dissolve it in alcohol.
Then take your twigs, sprays, or anything you
wish to imitate coral, and dip them in the above mixture
until they are well dyed.</p>

<p>Baskets made of moss and filled with natural flowers,
add a fresh beauty to the tree. Balls made of cake, and
frosted all over, look like snow balls. Pop corn balls
make quite a show. Bits of cotton wool, covered with
diamond powder, and scattered over the tree, imitate
snow.</p>

<p>Take gold paper, cut it in strips a quarter of an inch
wide, and an inch and a half long. Take one of the
strips and fasten together with paste, forming a ring;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
then take another strip and pass it through the ring just
formed, and fasten it together with paste; continue this
process until you have made a long chain. A number
of these chains, festooned from branch to branch, resemble
chains of gold.</p>

<p>Fairies always please children, and are easily made.
Purchase some small, jointed wooden or china dolls, and
different colored tarlatans for dresses, and form the wings
of white tarlatan, or of white linen banking paper. Take
butterfly wings for a pattern; sew on gold and silver
spangles on dress and wings, or paste on tiny stars of
gold and silver paper. Cut little strips of gold paper,
and roll them up, as you do paper lamp-lighters, for the
wands. Fasten them with thread or wire to the hand of
the fairy. The crown of the queen can be made of gold
paper, cut in strips long enough to go round the head,
and cut it in points in front, and paste it round the head.
Fasten wire round the waists of the fairies, leaving one
long end to wind around the branches of the trees. Thus
they look as if they were flying.</p>

<p>Many pretty things can be made from egg-shells, such
as pitchers, bowls, goblets, and tiny cradles; ornament
them with gold paper and little colored pictures.</p>

<p>There are hundreds of little glittering toys, which can
be purchased for a few pennies, such as brass beads, little
looking-glasses, glass balls, gilded toys, &amp;c., too numerous
to mention; odd bits of tin hung among the
branches glitter very prettily.</p>

<p>Every member of a family preparing a Christmas tree,
should use his or her wits to contrive little inexpensive
ornaments; even the little ones, with some instruction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
can make many pretty things, and it will add tenfold to
their pleasure to feel they have assisted in ornamenting
their precious tree; only let them <em>think</em> they can do it,
and most assuredly it will be done.</p>

<p>In making presents, every member of the family
should strive to find out the wants and tastes of those to
whom they intend to give presents, thinking only of giving
pleasure, and not of personal gratification of their
pride or love of show. The golden rule our blessed
Saviour gave us should be ever uppermost in our minds.
Love should be the presiding genius of every home
festival.</p>

<p>God works upon our hearts in many and various ways.
Often the simplest thing in life may awaken us to a right
sense of his goodness and mercy. So in home influences,
if a Christmas tree every year can add one link
to the chain which binds us in love to one another, should
we not be paid for weeks of labor? Every child thus
early taught thoughtfulness for others, must feel the good
effects through life.</p>


<h3>2.—THE CHRISTMAS BRAN PIE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> bran pie is often used in England, in place of the
Christmas tree, or as an addition to the “Twelfth Night”
party.</p>

<p>It is within the means of every family, as its contents
can be inexpensive or expensive, according to the taste
and means of the maker.</p>

<p>First, a large wooden bowl should be obtained, or any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
large tin pan or dish. This can be covered with white
cloth or not, as the maker pleases; a wreath of evergreens
around the edge is an improvement.</p>

<p>The contents of the pie may be sugar hearts, rings,
kisses, or any bonbons, mock rings, or gold rings, indeed,
any article which can be easily tied up in a small bundle.
It is desirable that there should be many articles in this
pie that will cause fun and laughter. Blanks, such as an
empty box, or some trifle rolled up in many papers. A
bright piece of silver, called a lucky piece, or a half-sixpence,
enclosed in a nut-shell, and like all the rest of the
articles, tied up in paper, adds to the sport. All these
bundles should be placed in the large bowl or dish and
covered with bran. A large spoon can be laid on the
top of the pie.</p>

<p>This pie should be placed on the table, after a Christmas
dinner or supper, the guests or family all remaining
in their seats around the table. If there are many little
ones, it can be arranged beforehand, and have a servant,
or some member of the family, place the pie at the front
door, and ring the bell furiously and blow a trumpet;
also place a paper on the top of the pie, on which is
written, “A present from Santa Claus.” As soon as
the bell is rung, the ringer must disappear at once, as
children are wide awake at Christmas. We had a bran
pie brought in that way; the children rushed to the door,
and in their eagerness to see Santa Claus, ran past the
pie some distance, looking eagerly on all sides; when
they returned, one little boy declared he saw him whisking
round the corner of the street. When the pie is on
the table, everybody is invited to partake. Each in turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
takes a spoonful; whatever bundle the spoon touches is
theirs; the bundle must be opened at once and exhibited
before the next person dips. The very inappropriateness
of some of the gifts helps to create laughter, and there
is a good deal of amusement in the after exchanging, or
refusing to exchange, when the pie is all distributed.</p>


<h3>3.—TWELFTH NIGHT.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> England their festivities continue twelve days.
Twelfth Night is sometimes called “Old Christmas,” as
it was the day celebrated as Christmas before the almanac
was changed. The change was made by Pope
Gregory XIII., during the year 1752. Therefore Twelfth
Night has its own peculiar festivities. In some portions
of England they have a large gathering of friends.
During the evening two dishes of little frosted cakes are
passed round, one for the gentlemen and one for the
ladies. In each there is one cake with a ring, and one
with a broken sixpence. The two who get the ring will
be married before the year is out. The broken sixpence
indicates an old bachelor or an old maid; but if the two
agree to join their broken sixpence, there is a chance for
them. So says the old tradition.</p>

<p>A lady, whose early youth was spent in England, says
where she lived Twelfth Night was celebrated especially
by the children. At their social parties they
selected a king and queen, who regulated the festivities
of the evening. Sometimes the lady of the house prepared
cards, with various figures written or drawn upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
them, among them a king and queen. Each child drew
a card on entering, which designated the character he or
she was to represent. Of course the lady managed to
slip the cards of king and queen into the hands of those
best able to preside.</p>

<p>In one of our small cities, where there are several
families who unite in keeping Twelfth Night every year,
they have but one ring, and whoever gets it must give
the party the next year.</p>


<h3>4.—THE CHRISTMAS BAG.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Make</span> a large bag of thin white paper or silver paper,
fill it with sugar plums, and tie a string around the top,
to keep it fast. Then suspend it from the ceiling, or
from a large door frame, and provide a long, light stick.
Each little child is blindfolded in turn, and the stick put
into his or her hand. She is then led within reach of
the bag, and told to strike it. If she succeeds in her aim
and tears a hole in it, the sugar plums are scattered on
the floor, and the little ones scramble for them; but it is
by no means easy to strike a suspended object blindfolded;
generally many attempts are made unsuccessfully.
Each child is allowed three trials. The maker
of the bag can put in it tiny books, pincushions, or any
little toy, with the sugar plums. This bag would add
to a child’s party; it is often used at birthday parties.
An older person should always superintend, for some
children would be greedy or rude.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shakespeare</span> reading clubs, private theatricals, charades,
and tableaux are deservedly the popular home
amusements of the present day. They certainly
strengthen the lungs and memory, and improve the intellectual
tastes. These amusements are peculiarly adapted
to enliven long winter evenings. As some of our young
friends may not understand the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus operandi</i> of these
amusements, we will try and enlighten them.</p>


<h3>1.—SHAKESPEARE READING CLUBS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> clubs read Shakespeare alone. It is most certainly
a noble study, and one we can never weary of.
Few can hope ever to excel in delineating Shakespeare.
Therefore it is well, if we meet together for social enjoyment
as well as improvement, to have a variety of plays,
such as Sheridan Knowles’ plays. Also, it is an admirable
way of learning to converse easily in German and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
French to read plays in the different languages. In
reading these plays, the parts, in the beginning, should be
given to different members.</p>

<p>The librettos of many excellent plays can be bought
for a very small sum, such as “Ion,” “Hunchback,”
“William Tell,” “Love’s Sacrifice,” and many other excellent
old plays. These small books are less cumbersome
to carry around. It is well before the club meets
to read any play, to have each person read over his or
her part, so as to be able to comprehend the character.
Therefore the play to be read at each reading should be
given out at the close of every meeting, and the parts
selected, each member having an equal share. Such
clubs are far more agreeable to its members, and less
likely to cause unpleasant rivalries, than clubs for private
theatricals, as private actors are often jealous, for human
nature, alas! is weak.</p>

<p>We have known of some very successful clubs, where
discord and jealousy never appeared, and where harmony
reigned. We will give the manner of proceeding adopted
by one of them, as it may assist in the formation of
others. The club was started by some young ladies, with
a view of making home and winter evenings agreeable
to their brothers. A committee was chosen to form a
code of laws. Each one was to subscribe a small sum
to purchase the librettos of their plays. The following
rules were signed by all the members:—</p>

<p>1. Each member of the club must take his or her
turn in choosing a play, and in giving out the rôle of
characters.</p>

<p>2. Every member must take the characters given him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
and do his best, unless he can exchange parts with some
other member, with the consent of the one who selected
the play.</p>

<p>3. The one who selects the play has a right to the best
character.</p>

<p>4. The club shall meet once a week at the houses of
members, in alphabetical rotation.</p>

<p>5. Whenever any member is unable to take his part
and cannot attend the meeting, he must provide some one
to take his character.</p>

<p>6. No new member can be admitted without the vote
of the majority.</p>

<p>7. Each member must study his or her part well, before
meeting with the club. If any two, or several,
should have difficult parts together, they must meet privately
and practise them.</p>

<p>At first they merely read the plays; but soon they
partially acted them, and found them increased in enterest
thereby. They always had their little librettos by
them. Those who had ready memories rarely referred
to them, or a mere glance would be sufficient. Finally
they dressed in character, and admitted an audience composed
of their relatives.</p>

<p>There is not necessarily anything awkward in having
the books in hand. Such little pamphlets can be easily
rolled up, and will scarcely be noticed. Under these
rules they became familiar with the best plays, without
wearying of them, and each member had an opportunity
of consulting his own taste.</p>

<p>Before the winter closed the members of this club
found they could so easily learn their parts, that they rarely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
were obliged to refer to their librettos. Constant practice
improved their memories. Often those whose parts were
associated together, would meet for private practice.</p>


<h3>2.—PRIVATE THEATRICALS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Private theatricals</span> amuse a large circle of <em>friends</em>,
and any club willing to undertake the presentation of
plays deserve the thanks of their audience.</p>

<p>Even a simple farce requires much labor and frequent
rehearsals to be well acted, and one soon wearies of the
constant repetition of even witty sayings. The most
trivial character must be carefully studied, for one bad
actor often destroys the effect of the whole play. Then
the footlights, stage, &amp;c., must be prepared. A few
directions, with a list of easy farces, may be of service.
All who live in cities can easily hire scenery, dresses,
&amp;c., but for the benefit of towns and villages, we will
give a short account of how such things can be managed.</p>

<p>Some lady can almost always be found who will give
the use of her house. A house should be selected which
has two parlors, connected by large folding doors or an
arch; one parlor being for the audience, and the other
for the stage. All the furniture and carpets should be
taken from the latter room. A rough staging should be
built (boards can be easily hired), and by boring a hole
in the floor, a gas pipe can be run up along the front of the
staging, with a sufficient number of burners. Tin shades<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
painted green (as they render the light softer, and more
agreeable to the eye), are an addition, for they keep the
light from the audience, and throw it directly on the
actors. A large floor cloth can be nailed on the stage
for a carpet. A drop curtain, so arranged as to be rolled
up quickly and easily, by means of a cord pulley at one
side of the stage, where the prompter sits, just out of
sight of the audience, is necessary. Scenery for the sides
and back parts of the stage can be roughly painted on
cloth; it answers every purpose of canvas, by being
strained when wet, over light wooden frames (made so
as to be easily moved); when dry, it presents a smooth,
hard surface.</p>

<p>Each member should provide his or her own dress.
To give the required expressions to the faces, a box of
good water colors, some fine chalk powder, camel’s hair
pencils, and rouge saucers are wanted. To make frowns,
scowls, or comical expressions, such as a broad grin,
smirk, or simper, stand before a mirror and assume the
desired expression; then trace the wrinkles produced
with a fine brush of the brown tint; this will fix the
required expression on your face. Rouge is best applied
with the finger. Burnt cork is excellent for darkening
eyebrows and making moustaches, also for representing
leanness, which will be done by applying a faint tint just
under the eyes, on the sides of the cheeks, and under the
lower lip. A strong mark running from the corner of
the nose down towards the corner of the mouth on each
side marks age or emaciation.</p>

<p>A few directions may be of use in regard to the preparation
of theatrical dresses. Powdered wigs can be made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
of tow, ravelled yarn, or gray-colored horse hair; beards
and moustache of the same, or a piece of buffalo skin.
Ermine can be made of cotton flannel, with tags of lion-skin
cloth sewed on, or black tags painted. Pelisse wadding
is sometimes used.</p>

<p>Crowns and sceptres are easily made of pasteboard
and gold paper. Velvet talma cloaks, capes, or even the
loose velvet sack, can be converted into cavalier cloaks
(the armholes in the sack must be fastened up on the
inside) by fastening them gracefully over one shoulder.
Then put on a large old-fashioned lace collar, ruffles
around the hand, a Kossuth hat, looped up on one side
with a paste pin or buckle, fastening a white or black
plume (taken from some lady’s bonnet), stockings drawn
over the pantaloons and fastened at the knees with bows
and buckles; and, lo! with but little trouble, you have a
fine cavalier of the olden times. With old finery and
little ingenuity, a theatrical wardrobe can be quickly
made, if all are willing to do their part, but the larger
share of the work is generally done by a few. Rocks
can be made by throwing plain gray blanket shawls over
ottomans, tables, &amp;c. Rain may be imitated by dropping
peas in a tin pan; thunder, by rattling sheet iron; lightning
by means of a tin tube, larger at one end than the
other, and filled with powdered resin. The smaller end
of the tube should be open, the other end so managed
that the resin may sift through. Shake the tube over a
lamp, or blow the resin through a plain tube into the
flame of a lamp, and you will have a good imitation of
lightning.</p>

<p>Dissolve crystals of nitrate of copper in spirits of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
wine, light the solution and it will burn with a beautiful
emerald green flame. Pieces of sponge, soaked in this
spirit, lighted and suspended by fine wires over the stage
of theatres, produce the lambent green flames now so
common in incantation scenes. Strips of flannel saturated
with it, and wrapped around pieces of copper, will
form the swords and fire-forks brandished by the demons
in such scenes. Devices like the above are very simple,
and add much to the general effect.</p>

<p>The publishers of this book have printed a large number
of small plays, adapted for private theatricals, called

known to all.</p>

<h3>3.—CHARADES.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is no game that can afford so much amusement
to a circle of friends as that of acting charades.
It affords a scope for the exercise of both wit and ingenuity.</p>

<p>A word must be chosen, in which the syllables may be
rendered into some kind of a lively performance, and the
whole word must be capable of similar representation.
Then the plan of action must be agreed upon. Old-fashioned
garments, gay shawls, scarfs, old coats, hats,
aprons, gowns, &amp;c., must be looked up for the occasion,
and speedily converted into various and grotesque costumes,
suited to the representation to be made. By
exercising a little ingenuity, very fine charades can be
acted “impromptu.” Speed, in all preparations, is quite
necessary to success, as an audience is always impatient.
If it is determined to have charades at a party, the lady
of the house should arrange dresses, plan of action, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
subjects, beforehand. She can generally tell who can
assist her best. If all the arrangements can be made
without the knowledge of her guests, the effect will be
greatly increased. This is also an improving game for a
family of children. Write the plot and a simple dialogue,
and let them learn it; it will be a good exercise
for the memory, and teach them ease of manner; but
let them only act before a home circle.</p>

<p>A talented friend of ours has a very pleasant way of
acting charades in her own family circle, which is well
adapted for large family circles, such as assemble together
on Thanksgiving, and during Christmas holidays. This
lady unites her family with a few other pleasant friends.</p>

<p>For a good charade party, twelve or more persons are
desirable, and two rooms, connecting by sliding or folding
doors, are the most convenient, though two connecting
by only a single door will do, if the party is not a
large one.</p>

<p>First, two persons should be chosen managers; then
the managers must choose sides, so that the company
will be about equally divided. The sides then take separate
rooms, to become, alternately, actors and audience;
the managers draw lots to see which side shall act first.
Those that are to begin, first choose a word, then proceed
to represent it. A common way is to divide the
word into syllables, and present one at each scene, then,
after having gone through the word, if the other side
cannot guess it, a scene is given to represent the whole
word. When all is ready for a scene, the door is thrown
open for the others to look in and guess it. Frequently
a whole word is given at once in one scene. The manager<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
must always announce whether one syllable or more
is given. After giving the audience time to guess it or
give it up, the parties change rooms, and the other side
must act; they will, of course, have their word selected
and all arrangements made, as they had sufficient time
while waiting for the others.</p>

<p>In acting the word, each party must try to mystify the
other, yet the syllable must be well represented; but
there can be by-play to divert the audience from the real
word. The party that guesses the whole word the soonest,
are considered the conquering party. Care must be
taken not to let the actors know if the audience guess the
word before it is fully acted.</p>

<p>Sometimes in the place of words, proverbs are acted.
Each word is acted in turn, or two words are acted in
one scene; if the latter, before the scene is acted, some
one of the actors can inform the audience that they will
act two words of the proverb.</p>

<p>A few directions for acting certain words and proverbs,
and a short list of words and proverbs easy to be acted,
may be an assistance to our youthful readers.</p>

<p>If a word or syllable can be represented by action, it
should be seldom spoken; but in some cases syllables
must be spoken to give an idea of the word. Some prefer
acting charades entirely in pantomime.</p>


<h3>4.—CON-JU-GATE.</h3>

<p><em>Con.</em> Arrange a school, one of the actors dressing as
a country schoolmaster; let the scholars all have books
in their hands, conning their lessons in loud whispers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Ju.</em> The same school can be retained. One of the
actors, dressed as a German Jew pedler, can come to the
school to sell pens, pencils, paper, chalk, &amp;c. He can
talk in a broken Jewish manner. The <em>Jew</em> should be
prominent in this scene.</p>

<p><em>Gate.</em> This syllable, instead of the common representation
of a gate, made with a small clothes-frame, &amp;c.,
can be represented by having the whole company of actors
dress in odd garments, and walk about the room in
couples, each with a different gait, hobbling, striding,
pompous, &amp;c.</p>

<p><em>Conjugate.</em> Let the same schoolmaster assemble his
unruly school, and give out verbs to be conjugated; the
scholars, to make the scene ridiculous, should mix up
languages and conjugations in a medley.</p>


<h3>5.—DUMB-FOUND.</h3>

<p><em>Dumb.</em> Let a certain number of the actors be seated
in a row, when the door opens, or the curtain is drawn
aside; let them remain perfectly silent for two moments,
then let them silently rise and walk out of the room. Or
as they sit silent, some actor can come in and ask questions
to each, receiving only a vacant stare in answer;
he then can rush out of the room, calling them a stupid
set; it would be too plain to call them dumb.</p>

<p><em>Found.</em> This can be made very amusing by arranging
a court scene, judge, jury, and lawyers, and a prisoner’s
box, in which an actor, dressed as a servant-girl, can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
be seated as the criminal accused of stealing a pocket-book.
Witnesses can be examined. After the court has
gone over the case, and the lawyers make as much sport
as possible in their examination, a boy, dressed as a ragged
Irish boy, should rush in, pocket-book in hand, calling
on the judge to hear him. After ordering him to be
turned out, and much talk being made about turning
him out, at last, in a broken Irish voice, he must scream
out, “Plaase yer honor, it’s me that <em>found</em> it,” holding
aloft the pocket-book. The judge must request to see
the pocket-book. (A young boy once acting this part,
caused much laughter, by exclaiming, “Och, and indade
is the court honest?”) The judge having examined the
pocket-book, declares the girl innocent, and dismisses the
court.</p>

<p><em>Dumbfound.</em> The room should be partially darkened,
and some of the actors seated around the room talking
as they please. One of the actors can be dressed as a
ghost. A giant ghost acted by dressing up an umbrella,
or a broom, arranging it with long white drapery of sheets,
and the person carrying it can raise the dressed-up umbrella
or broom as they enter the room. The ghost can
glide slowly around the room; its occupants should exhibit
silent horror, either by crouching down, contortions
of the face, or in any way possible, but not a sound
should be uttered.</p>


<h3>6.—SO-RO-SIS.</h3>

<p><em>So.</em> One of the actors should be dressed as a schoolmistress;
some children can be seated by her with patchwork<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
in their hands. The mistress can teach them sewing,
while in another part of the room an actor must
hold some papers of seeds, and pretend to be sewing the
seeds in a box or pot of earth.</p>

<p><em>Ro.</em> Place the actors all in a row; let them stand
gazing at the audience a moment, then all at the same
time make a low bow to the audience, and that scene is
over.</p>

<p><em>Sis.</em> Have a school, and the master should call “sis”
to come and recite; any little girl can take the part of
“sis,” or some boy can complain of his “sis” to the
teacher.</p>

<p><em>Sorosis.</em> Can be made very amusing by representing
an assembly of strong-minded women. The gentlemen
actors can dress in outlandish dresses, and act the part
of women. They can choose a president, and other
officers, &amp;c.</p>


<h3>7.—LAMENTABLE.</h3>

<p class="center">FRENCH CHARADE.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">“L’amont”</span> can be acted well in pantomime by representing
an old deaf man, and his young wife; the old
man with spectacles on nose, sitting in a large chair,
reading the newspaper, his young wife standing behind
the chair. A low tap is heard at the door. She starts
and listens; the door opens slyly and discovers a young
man. She starts with delight, but points to the old man,
motioning the young man to go. He makes gestures of
despair; then appears to have a sudden thought, bows,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
and retires. Soon a loud knock is heard; she goes to
the door, and returns with a letter, giving it to the old
man; he reads, shakes his head, and hands it to her; she
looks at it, runs for his hat and coat, and motions him to
go. He leaves at one door, while <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L’Aman</i> enters at
another. Then they act a lover-like scene, and the curtain
drops.</p>

<p><em>Table.</em> She again appears with sleeves rolled up,
apron on, rolling-pin in hand, making cakes, the young
lover standing by, and now and then eating one of the
cakes. They hear a heavy step, and the lover runs for a
hiding-place. At last he springs under the table, and
she pulls a table cloth down around it, and goes on rolling
cakes. In comes the old man, hobbling along. He
looks around and suspects something, and begins a strict
search. Thus ends that scene.</p>

<p><em>Lamentable.</em> The same actors appear, but the table is
turned over, and, behold! the old man has seized the
young lover, and is brandishing aloft a heavy cane,
while the young wife appears, weeping bitterly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The following words are easy to be acted:—</p>

<ul>
<li>Back-bite.</li>
<li>Com-fort.</li>
<li>In-fan-tile.</li>
<li>Pa-pa-cy.</li>
<li>Fare-well.</li>
<li>Car-pet.</li>
<li>Bond-age.</li>

<li>Trans-mute.</li>
</ul>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>


<h3>8.—PROVERBS.</h3>

<p class="center">SAFE BIND, SAFE FIND.</p>

<p><em>Safe.</em> An actor takes the part of a distracted mother,
rushes around the room exclaiming, “My child is lost!”
“He must be drowned!” &amp;c. Soon one of the actors can
rush in with a child, exclaiming, “Madam, your child is
<em>safe</em>, but I found him in a little boat, floating out to
sea;” other actors can rush in, all talking at once, some
scolding the child, others rejoicing he is safe.</p>

<p><em>Bind.</em> The one acting the part of mother can be
seated with her work in her hands, and in her basket
some rolls of old cotton. Three children can come in
crying, one with a cut head (take some red paint, and
make a splash on the forehead to represent blood), exclaiming,
“O, dear, I’m killed, I know.” The other,
limping and crying, “O, my foot is broken! O, dear!
O, dear!” The other complaining of her hand, all talking
at once. The mother must order them to talk one at
a time, and she will bind up their wounds. Then she
can take her rolls of cotton and bind up the injured
parts.</p>

<p><em>Safe.</em> The mother and children can be seated talking,
when a knock comes at the door. One child opens the
door and admits a pedler; after showing some trifles, he
declares he has some wonderful money safes, and exhibits
some boxes, and expatiates on the virtues of his safes.
The mother can purchase one for each child.</p>

<p><em>Find.</em> The same mother can be seated as usual, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
the children must come running in, telling that one of
their number has lost his safe. They all hunt for it, and
look everywhere to find it, to no purpose.</p>

<p><em>Safe bind, safe find.</em> The scene opens with a little
girl tied into a chair, reading a book. The mother must
come in arrayed for the street. On entering, she must
exclaim, “I am thankful I have at last found a way to
keep my child from being lost.” Then she must turn to
the audience, and ask them if they can tell her the
proverb. If they cannot guess, she must ask if she shall
tell them. Sometimes the audience require time to talk it
over before they are willing to own they cannot guess it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One example will sufficiently illustrate the manner
proverbs are acted. We will now give a list of some
proverbs adapted for action.</p>


<ul>
<li>Ill weeds grow apace.</li>
<li>Little pitchers have large ears.</li>
<li>Fine feathers make fine birds.</li>
<li>Union is strength.</li>
<li>Time unveils truth.</li>
<li>Black cats have black kittens.</li>
<li>Necessity is the mother of invention.</li>
<li>All is not gold that glitters.</li>
<li>Slow and sure.</li>
</ul>



<h3>9.—TABLEAUX VIVANTS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Tableaux vivants</span>, as commonly represented, are so
well understood that no directions are necessary; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
some of our readers may not have heard of the illustration
of poems, &amp;c., by a series of living pictures. This
is far more interesting than simply to personify some one
picture. Still another way is to represent the different
verses and scenes in a song in pantomime, while at the
same time some one who is a good musician sings the
verses of the song, as they are represented. For instance,
“The Mistletoe Bough;” first represent a room
decorated with green, a company assembled, gayly dressed
and dancing, while a lady or gentleman behind the scene
sings the verse represented in distinct tones, and so on
through the whole song; the last scene, representing
children in a lumber-room opening an old chest, and exposing
a skeleton, old flowers, &amp;c. “Auld Robin Grey,”
“The Three Fishers,” “O, they marched through the
Town,” “She wore a wreath of Roses,” “The Minstrel’s
Return from the War,” are all excellent ballads to represent.</p>


<h3>10.—TABLEAUX OF STATUARY.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is a new form of tableaux, and if well done, exceedingly
beautiful.</p>

<p>To prepare and arrange groups of statuary requires
artistic skill, patience, and steady nerves; the
two last qualities are necessary for those acting as
statues.</p>

<p>A lady who excels in preparing groups of statues, as
we can testify, has kindly permitted us to give to the
public her manner of preparing them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>First, some effective groups of statuary must be
selected, and carefully examined. Then those persons
who are willing to gratify their friends by acting as
statues, can be arranged in the different groups according
to their fitness; those acting as statues, require marked
features, and in most groups fine figures to <em>build</em> upon,
as drapery conceals minor faults. All that can be prepared
before the evening, are the head gear and the articles
for drapery. A cap must be made of white linen or
cotton, closely fitting the head. Take candle-wicking,
and knit it on common sized ivory needles, wet it in hot
water, and iron it dry. Then ravel it out, and cut it into
the desirable lengths, and fasten it to the cap like a wig.
When placed on the head, this candle-wicking can be
arranged according to the statue to be represented, and
it will resemble the hair carved in marble. If expense
is not to be considered, the drapery should be made of
cotton flannel, as it hangs heavier, and is more easily
arranged than sheets, which are generally used to save
expense. From three to four sheets are often required
for the drapery of one person, as it is necessary to hang
in such heavy folds to look like marble. One is usually
doubled up and tied around the waist, the others folded,
tied, and pinned, to resemble the drapery of the statue
represented; rules are impossible to give, as the arrangement
can only be made by an ingenious as well as an
artistic person. Now comes the most disagreeable part,
that of painting all exposed parts, such as neck, face,
hands or feet, to resemble marble. First, common whiting
must be mixed smoothly in water, the consistency of
milk. This is put on with a shaving brush, and every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
part wholly covered with this preparation; let that nearly
dry, then rub it in with the hand, then rub in lily white,
to give the flesh, besides the whiteness of marble, the soft
look of polished marble. The lips are finished at the
last moment. Old white stocking legs drawn over the
arms will save the trouble of painting them. Then the
statues are ready to be grouped for exhibition. Any
person who is nervous, restless, and easily inclined to
laugh, cannot act as a statue. It is not possible to realize
the beauty of such a group of living statuary, when
well done, unless it has been once seen. We advise
those attempting to get up exhibitions for the benefit of
some charitable object, to try a few groups of living
statuary; it is very effective to an audience.</p>


<h3>11.—LIGHTS AND SHADES.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> you wish to throw the background of a tableau into
shadow, place screens between the lights at the sides of
the stage and that part of the picture you wish to have
dark; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versa</i> with the foreground. Particular points
or characters may be more brilliantly lighted than others,
by placing at the side of the stage a strong light within
a large box, open at one side, and lined with bright tin
reflectors.</p>

<p>Lights of different colors can be thrown successively
on a picture, and made to blend one with another, by
placing the various colored fires in boxes three feet
square, one at one side, and lined with reflectors. Those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
arranged at the sides of the stage on pivots, can be
turned on, one after another, so as to throw their light
on the stage. Before one light has entirely vanished
from the scene, a different color should gradually take its
place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ventriloquism</span> we always supposed, like many other
arts, depended to a certain extent on natural talent, or
was a peculiar gift.</p>

<p>Professional ventriloquists favor the idea that it is a
natural gift, in order to enhance their profits. But boys
of the present age are not so ready to believe in marvellous
gifts, and may have persevered in trying to imitate
famous ventriloquists, and to try was to succeed.</p>

<p>A friend of ours once met a boy only ten or eleven
years old, who was an excellent ventriloquist, so far as
the power of throwing the voice into a closet or adjoining
room goes. On being questioned if he could explain
the power he had, the boy said he had heard Harrington
the ventriloquist some time previous, and having a desire
to possess the same acquirement, he passed in practice in a
garret all the spare time he could get for many days, and
at the end of that time was fairly startled himself at
hearing a voice come distinctly from an old chest of
drawers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>The persevering little fellow had found out for himself
the true theory.</p>

<p>We will give our young friends some plain and simple
rules and directions how to acquire the power of ventriloquism,
which we have obtained from a reliable English
work; many persons following these rules have obtained
proficiency in this art, according as they devoted time
and attention to the subject. The word ventriloquism is
derived from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">venter</i>, the belly, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">loquor</i>, I speak;
literally signifying, belly-speaking.</p>


<h3>1.—WHAT IS VENTRILOQUISM.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Ventriloquism</span> may be divided into two sections, or
general heads, the first of which may be appropriately
designated as Polyphonism, consists of the simple imitation
of the voices of human creatures, of animals, of
musical instruments, and sounds and noises of every
description, in which no illusion is intended, but where,
on the contrary, the imitation is avowedly executed by
the mimic, among which we may classify sawing, planing,
door-creaking, sounds of musical instruments, and other
similar imitations.</p>

<p>Secondly, we have ventriloquism proper, which consists
in the imitation of such voices, sounds, and noises, not
as originally in him, but in some other appropriate
source, at a given or varying distance, in any, or even in
several directions, either singly or together, a process
exciting both wonder and amusement, and which may be
accomplished by thousands who have hitherto viewed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
ventriloquist as invested with a power wholly denied by
nature to themselves.</p>

<p>Polyphony is very common, for there is scarcely a
public school which does not possess at least one boy
capable of imitating the mewing of a cat, the barking of
a dog, or the squeaking voice of an old woman. It is
very seldom that even a blundering attempt at ventriloquism
is heard, except from a public platform, simply
from the want of knowledge of how to proceed. The
art does not depend on a particular structure or organization
of these parts, but may be acquired by almost any
one ardently desirous of attaining it, and determined to
persevere in repeated trials.</p>

<p>If a man, though in the same room with another,
can, by any peculiar modifications of the organs of
speech, produce a sound, which, in faintness, tone, body,
and every other sensible quality, perfectly resembles a
sound delivered from the roof of an opposite house, the
ear will naturally, without examination, refer it to that
situation and distance; the sound which he hears being
only a sign, which from infancy he has been accustomed
by experience to associate with the idea of a person
speaking from the house-top. A deception of this kind
is practised with success on the organ and other musical
instruments.</p>

<p>The English Cyclopædia says “the <em>essence</em> of ventriloquy
consists in creating illusions as to the distance and
direction whence a sound has travelled.” How these
sounds are produced, we will now show.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>


<h3>2.—THE THEORY OF VENTRILOQUISM.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Many</span> physiologists aver that ventriloquism is produced
by speaking during the inspiration of air. It is quite
possible to articulate under these circumstances, and the
plan may be occasionally adopted; but the practical
experience of many performers prove that the general
current of utterance is, as in ordinary speech, during
<em>expiration</em> of the breath.</p>

<p>Some think ventriloquism comprises a management of
the echoes; but echo only repeats what has been already
spoken. Baron Mingon, a famous ventriloquist, had an
automaton doll with which he could apparently converse.
He thus describes his <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus operandi</i>: “<i>I press my
tongue against the teeth, and thus circumscribe a cavity
between my left cheek and teeth, in which the voice is produced
by the air held in reserve in the pharynx</i>. The
sounds thus receive a hollow and muffled tone, which
causes them to appear to come from a distance.” The
Baron says, “It is essential to have the breath well under
control, and not to respire more than can be avoided.”
Ventriloquists often experience fatigue in the chest, and
have attributed it to the slow expiration of the breath.
Some are often compelled to cough during the progress
of exercitation.</p>

<p>To attain an exact and positive knowledge of the
modifications of voice specified as ventriloquism, it is
important to be familiar with the distinctions of the
sounds uttered by the mouth; and to ascertain how the
organs act in producing those vocal modifications, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
necessary to know how the breath is vocalized in all its
distinctions of pitch, loudness, and quality, by the ordinary
actions of the vocal organs. In ordinary language
we speak of noise, of common sound, and of musical
sounds. A quill striking a piece of wood causes a noise,
but striking successively against the teeth of a wheel, or
of a comb, a continued sound, and if the teeth of the
wheel are at equal distances, and the velocity of the
rotation is constant, a musical sound.</p>

<p>Phonation, or the production of voice, is a result of
actions taking place under two distinct classes of laws,
namely: the ordinary mechanical laws of acoustics, and
the physiological laws of muscular movement. The
adjustment of the vocal mechanism to be brought into
operation by the current of air, is made by actions, under
the latter laws; and phonation is the result of the reaction
of the mechanism on the current of air by mechanical
movements under the former laws. Now the pitch
of the voice essentially depends on the tension of the
vocal ligaments; the loudness on the extent of the
excursion of these ligaments in their vibrations; the
duration on the continuance of the vocalizing causes;
the equality on the organization of the larynx, and also
on the form and size of the vocal tube. The form and
size of this tube can be altered in various ways. For
instance, by dilating or contracting the mouth; by contracting
the communication between the pharynx and
mouth, so as to constitute them distinct chambers, or by
dilating the opening so as to throw them into one, which
is chiefly attained by movements of the soft palate, and
by altering the form of the mouth’s cavity, which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
effected by varying the position of the tongue. Each of
these modifications of the vocal tube conveys a peculiarity
of quality to the voice, all, however, being local or
laryngeal sounds. Moreover, sounds can be produced in
the vocal tube, apart from the larynx. These, strictly
speaking, are not vocal sounds, though some of them
may be of a definite and uniform pitch, while others are
mere noises, as rattling, whispering, gurgling, whistling,
snoring, and the like. Now, as everything audible
comes under the classes of noise, sound, or musical
sound, and as each variety originates in the vocal apparatus
of man, it is obvious that <em>an ordinary vocal apparatus
is all that is required</em> for the achievement of the
feats of ventriloquy.</p>

<p>A person in a house cannot judge by the noise of an
approaching carriage, with any certainty, whether it is
coming from the right or left. Thus it is in many other
sounds. <em>But we judge the direction sound has travelled
from its source on reaching the ear.</em> The ventriloquist
indicates, either directly or indirectly, the direction from
which he wishes his audience to believe the sound is
coming. Thus he directly indicates it by words, such
as, “Are you up there?” “He is up the chimney,”
“He is in the cellar,” “Are you down there?” &amp;c.
He indirectly indicates it by some suggestive circumstance,
as an action or gesture, which is so skilfully
unobtrusive and natural as to effect its object without
being discovered. Thus, when the ventriloquist looks or
listens in any direction, or even simply turns towards any
point, as if he expected sound to come thence, <em>the attention
of an audience is by that means instantly directed</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
<em>to the same place</em>. Thus, before a sound is produced, the
audience expect it to come in the <em>suggested direction</em>, and
the ventriloquist has merely by his <em>adjustment of vocal
loudness</em>, to indicate the necessary distance, when a
<em>misjudgment of the audience will complete the illusion
which he has begun</em>.</p>

<p>The effect which is produced on sound by its travelling
from a distance, is observed to be,—</p>

<p>1. That its loudness is reduced in proportion to its
distance.</p>

<p>2. That its pitch remains unaltered.</p>

<p>3. That its quality or tone is somewhat altered.</p>

<p>4. That its duration remains unaltered.</p>

<p>5. That the human speech is <em>somewhat obscured</em>, chiefly
in the consonant sounds.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that the ventriloquist makes
the sound, not as it is heard at its source, <em>but as it is
heard after travelling from a distance</em>.</p>

<p>Too much attention cannot be bestowed on the <em>study
of sound as it falls on the ear</em>, and an endeavor to imitate
it as it is heard, <em>for the secret of the art is, that as perspective
is to the eye, so is ventriloquism to the ear</em>.
When we look at a painting of a landscape, some of the
objects appear at a distance, but we know that it is only
the skill of the artist which has made it appear as the eye
has seen it in reality. In exactly the same manner a
ventriloquist acts upon and deceives the ear, by <em>producing
sounds</em> as they are heard from any known distances.</p>

<p>We have given the acoustical theory of the effect on
the auric nerve, and the means are the organs of respiration
and sound with the adjoining muscles. The organs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
and muscles used are the diaphragm, the lungs, the
trachea, the larynx, the pharynx, and the mouth.</p>


<h3>3.—PRACTICAL RULES AND ILLUSTRATIONS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first voice a student of ventriloquism will strive
to acquire is what is called “The voice in the closet.”
To acquire this voice, which we so name for distinction’s
sake, speak any word or sentence in your own natural
tones; then open the mouth, and <em>fix the jaws</em> fast, as
though you were trying to hinder any one from opening
them farther, or shutting them; draw the tongue back in
a ball; speak the same words, and the sound, instead of
being formed in the mouth, will be formed in the
pharynx. Great attention must be paid to holding the
jaws rigid. The sound will then be found to imitate a
voice heard from the other side of a door when it is
closed, or under a floor, or through a wall. To ventriloquize
with this voice, let the operator stand with his back
to the audience, against a door. Give a gentle tap at
the door, and call aloud in the natural voice, inquiring,
“Who is there?” This will have the effect of drawing
the attention of the audience to a person supposed to be
outside. Then fix the jaw as described, and utter in the
“closet voice” any words you please, such as, “I want
to come in.” Ask questions in the natural voice, and
answer in the other. When you have done this, open
the door a little, and hold a conversation with the imaginary
person. As the door is now open, it is obvious that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
the voice must be altered, for a voice will not sound to
the ear when a door is open the same as when closed.
Therefore the voice must be made to <em>appear</em> face to face,
or close to the ventriloquist. To do this, the voice must
not be altered from the <em>original note or pitch</em>, but be made
in another part of the mouth. This is done by closing
the lips tight and drawing one corner of the mouth
downwards, or towards the ear. Then let the lips open
at that corner only, the other part to remain closed.
Next, breathe, as it were, the words out of the orifice
formed.</p>

<p>Do not speak distinctly, but expel the breath in short
puffs at each word, and as loud as possible. By so doing
you will <em>cause the illusion</em> in the mind of the listeners
that they hear the same voice which they heard when
the door was closed, but which is now heard more distinctly
and nearer on account of the door being open.
This voice must always be used when the ventriloquist
wishes it to appear that the sound comes through an
obstacle, but from some one close at hand.</p>

<p>The description of voice and dialogue may be varied,
as in the following example:—</p>

<p>“The Suffocated Victim.” This was a favorite illustration
of Mr. Love, the Polyphonist.</p>

<p>A large box or closed cupboard is used indiscriminately,
as it may be handy. The student will rap or
kick the box, apparently by accident.</p>

<p>The voice will then utter a hoarse and subdued groan,
apparently from the box or closet.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Student.</i> (Pointing to the box with an air of astonishment.)
What was that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Voice.</i> O, let me out!</p>

<p><i>Student.</i> Why! there is some one in here, I declare
(to box). Who is it?</p>

<p><i>Voice.</i> I won’t do so any more. I am nearly dead.</p>

<p><i>Student.</i> Who are you? How came you there?</p>

<p><i>Voice.</i> You know very well who I am. Let me out!
Let me out!</p>

<p><i>Student.</i> I tell you I don’t know you.</p>

<p><i>Voice.</i> O, yes, you do.</p>

<p><i>Student.</i> Tell me quick. Who are you?</p>

<p><i>Voice.</i> Your old school-fellow, Tom ——; you know
me.</p>

<p><i>Student.</i> Why, he’s in Canada.</p>

<p><i>Voice.</i> (Sharply.) You know better; he’s here; but
be quick.</p>

<p><i>Student.</i> (Opening the lid.) Perhaps he’s come by
the underground railroad. Hallo!</p>

<p><i>Voice.</i> (Not so muffled as described in direction.)
Now, then, give us a hand.</p>

<p><i>Student.</i> (Closing the lid or door sharply.) No, I
won’t.</p>

<p><i>Voice.</i> (As before.) Have pity (Dick, or Mr. ——,
as the case may be), or I shall be choked.</p>

<p><i>Student.</i> I believe you are a humbug.</p>

<p><i>Voice.</i> Why don’t you let me out and see, before I
am dead?</p>

<p><i>Student.</i> (Opening and shutting the lid or door, and
saying, the voice accordingly.) Dead! not you. When
did you leave Canada?</p>

<p><i>Voice.</i> Last week. O, I am choking!</p>

<p><i>Student.</i> Shall I let him out? (Opening the door.)
There is no one here.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>Conversations can be held with pedlers at the door, or
with some one in the cellar or basement; and as a rule
the lower notes of the voice will be best for voices in the
basement, and formed as low in the chest as possible.</p>

<p>The second kind of voice, or voice No. 2, we will call
it, is more easy to be acquired. It is the voice by which
all ventriloquists make a supposed person speak from a
long distance, or from or through the ceiling. In the
first place, with your back to the audience, <em>direct their attention</em>
to the ceiling, <em>by pointing to it</em>, or by looking intently
at it. Call loudly, and ask some questions, as
though believed a person to be concealed there. Make
your own voice very distinct, and as near the lips as possible,
as that will help the illusion. Then, in <em>exactly the
same tone and pitch</em>, answer; <em>but, in order that the voice
may seem to proceed from the point indicated, the words
must be formed at the back part of the roof of the mouth</em>.
To do this, the lower jaw must be drawn back and held
there, the mouth open, <em>which will cause the palate to be elevated
and drawn nearer to the pharynx</em>, and the sound
will be reflected in that cavity, and appear to come from
the roof. Too much attention cannot be paid to the
manner in which the breath is used in this voice. When
speaking to the supposed person, expel the words with a
deep, quick breath.</p>

<p>When answering in the imitative voice, the breath
must be <em>held back, and expelled very slowly, and the voice
will come in a subdued and muffled manner</em>, little above
a whisper, but so as to be well distinguished. To cause
the supposed voice to come nearer by degrees, call loudly,
and say, “I want you down here!” or words to that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
effect; <em>at the same time make a motion downwards with
your hands</em>. Hold some conversation with the voice,
and cause it to say, “I am coming,” or “Here I am,”
each time indicating the descent with the hand.</p>

<p>Let the voice, at every supposed step, roll, as it were,
by degrees, <em>from the pharynx more into the cavity of the
mouth</em>, and at each supposed step <em>contracting the opening
of the mouth</em>, until the lips are drawn up as if you were
whistling. By so doing, the cavity of the mouth will be
very much enlarged. This will cause the voice <em>to be obscured,
and so to appear</em> to come nearer by degrees. At
the same time care must be taken not to articulate the
consonant sounds plainly, as that would cause the disarrangement
of the lips and cavity of the mouth; and in
all <em>imitation voices</em> the consonants must scarcely be articulated
at all, <em>especially if the ventriloquist faces the audience</em>.
For example, suppose the imitative voice is
made to say, “Mind what you are doing, you bad boy,”
it must be spoken as if it were written, “ind ot you’re
doing, you ’ad whoy.” (It is rarely a ventriloquist
shows a full face to his audience, unless at a great distance
from them. It would help to destroy the illusion
if the jaws were seen to move.) This kind of articulation
is made by forming the words in the pharynx, and
then sending them out of the mouth by sudden expulsions
of the breath clean from the lungs at every word. This
is often illustrated by a ventriloquist pretending to talk
to a man on the roof.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>


<h3>4.—POLYPHONIC IMITATIONS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Love</span>, the great polyphonist, delighted in his youth
to imitate the buzzing of insects and the cries of animals.
Such accomplishments are easily acquired, and we think
if our young boy friends will follow our directions, they
will acquire at least polyphonic powers to amuse their
friends at home and abroad.</p>

<p>To imitate a “tormenting bee,” a boy must use considerable
pressure on his chest, as if he was about to
groan suddenly, but instead of which the sound must be
confined and prolonged in the throat; the greater the
pressure, the higher will be the faint note produced, and
which will perfectly resemble the buzzing of the bee or
wasp. In all imitations of insect noises, the bee should
be heard to hum gently at first, so as in a private party
not to attract attention till the right pitch is obtained.
The sound will penetrate every corner of a large room.
To assist the illusion, the person imitating a bee should
pretend to try to catch the insect. To imitate the buzzing
of a blue-bottle fly, it will be necessary for the sound
to be made with the lips instead of the throat: this is
done by closing the lips very tight, except at one corner,
where a small aperture is left; fill that cheek full of
wind, but not the other, then slowly blow or force the
wind contained in the cheek out of the aperture; if this
is done properly, it will cause a sound exactly like the
buzzing of a blue-bottle fly.</p>

<p>To make the above perfectly effective, the person imitating
a fly or bee, should turn his face to the wall;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
with a handkerchief strike at the pretended bee or fly, at
the same time pretend to follow his victim, first this way
and then that, and finally to “dab” his pocket handkerchief
on the wall, as though he had killed it; the sound
should be at times suddenly louder and then softer,
which will make it appear as it is heard in different
parts of the room.</p>

<p>“The Spectre Carpenter.” The noise caused by
planing and sawing wood we often hear imitated. Yet
but few boys know how easily it is done. Much amusement
is often caused by this imitation. To imitate planing,
a boy must stand at a table a little distance from the
audience, and appear to take hold of a plane and push it
forward; the sound, as of a plane, is made as though you
were dwelling on the last part of the word <em>hash</em>. Dwell
upon the <em>sh</em> a little, <em>tsh</em>, and then clip it short by causing
the tongue to close with the palate, then over again. Letters
will not carry the peculiar sound of sawing; but
any bright boy, by carefully listening to the sound made
by carpenters, with these suggestions, can, with practice,
imitate the sound perfectly. To make the deception more
perfect, put some shavings in your pocket to sprinkle as
you pretend to saw, also a piece of wood to fall when
the sawing is ended. A friend of ours told us of a
negro, well known as a famous whistler about the streets
of Boston years ago, who would place both hands tightly
over his ears, incline his head downwards, and imitate
with great precision a music-box; but he said it pained
him to do this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>


<h3>5.—TO IMITATE AN ECHO.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is impossible for a ventriloquist to produce an echo
in a room of ordinary size, as the walls, being so near,
would cause the sounds to be blended, and would only
produce one impression on the ear; and yet a skilful
ventriloquist can with ease imitate, in a room, a mountain
echo. We will give the instructions, as it is very
amusing.</p>

<p>Turn your back to the listeners; whistle loud several
short, quick notes, just as if you were whistling to a dog;
then as quick as possible, after the last note, and as softly
and subdued as possible to be heard, whistle about a
third the number of notes, but it must be in the <em>same
note or pitch</em>; this will cause the last whistle to appear
just like an echo at a great distance. This imitation, if
well done, causes much surprise to those listening. The
same thing can be done by shouting any sentence, such
as, “Halloa, you, there!” or, “Ship, ahoy!” Let
your voice be formed close to the lips; then quickly,
and in the <em>same pitch or note</em>, speak the same words very
subdued, and formed at the back of the mouth. This is
very simple, yet effective.</p>

<h3>6.—CONCLUDING REMARKS.</h3>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Any</span> person acquainted with the voices before described,
may imitate many others by <em>contraction and
expansion of the glottis, and by modifications of the cavity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
of the pharynx and mouth</em>. The best way to practise is in
a room alone, to talk aloud, and, while so doing, to make
all sorts of <em>contortions with the muscles of the mouth and
jaws, first fixing the jaws</em> in the manner already described,
<em>then drawing the lips inward, next putting them forward,
at the same time placing the tongue in different shapes
and positions in the mouth</em>; also by speaking in the natural
voice, and answering in the <em>falsetto pitch</em>, which is the
imitating voice for women and children.”</p>

<p>The ordinary compass of a voice is about twelve notes,
and a very good practice to the attainment of the art is
to call aloud in a certain note, <em>and then in the octave to
that note</em>; do this several times a day, changing the note
or pitch, loud at first, and by degrees decrease the sounds;
this kind of practice will assist any one in learning to
modulate the voice to appear to recede or come near by
degrees.</p>

<p>We think enough has been said to enable <em>any boy</em>, sufficiently
persevering, to become a good ventriloquist.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
“Always remember, that to <em>render a voice perspective,
the most essential thing is to attend to the study of sound
as it falls upon an ear; then imitate that sound by the
different contractions and expansions of the muscles of the
throat, mouth, face, and jaws</em>. During these various contractions
and expansions, draw in a long breath, and talk,
first rapidly, then slowly, but always with a <em>slow expiration
of breath</em>. Do this a dozen times consecutively for
several days, at the same time <em>elevate and depress the
roof of the mouth</em>, especially the back part, as this movement
causes the voice to appear near or at a distance.”</p>

<p>We have now given our young friends the best practical
directions we could obtain from the rules given by a
skilful ventriloquist. All boys who have faithfully followed
our directions, should try their powers before some
friend. We think they will be astonished at their success,
and will be pleased to become a source of great
amusement to their friends as well as themselves. But
beware, boys, of <em>misusing</em> your power; always remember
the “golden rule,” and never frighten any person
seriously.</p>

<p>Ventriloquism was well known, even before Christ;
but it was used only as a means to foster superstition,
and often took the form of divination. The statue of
Memnon will instantly suggest itself as a familiar example.
The gigantic head was heard to speak the moment
the sun’s rays glanced on its features. Undoubtedly
the magic words were pronounced by the attendant
priest, who must have been a ventriloquist. We could
give innumerable instances of its use among the ancients;
but we will close with an amusing anecdote we once
heard of a famous ventriloquist. He was passing through
a street with a friend, at the same time a load of hay was
passing along. The ventriloquist called the attention
of his friend and others passing along to the suffocating
cries of a man in the centre of the hay. A crowd
gathered round and stopped the astonished carter, and
demanded why he was carrying a fellow-creature in his
hay. The complaints and cries of the suffocated man
now became fainter, and he appeared to be dying. The
crowd, instantly proceeded to unload the hay into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
street, the smothered voice urging them to make haste.
The feelings of the people may be imagined, when the
cart was found empty. The ventriloquist and his friend
walked off, laughing at the unexpected result of their
trick.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Æolian Harp</span> consists of an oblong box of thin
deal board, about five or six inches deep, with a circle
drawn in the middle of the upper side, an inch and a
half in diameter, around which are to be drilled small
holes. Along the upper side of the box seven, ten, or
more small strings, of very fine gut, are stretched over
bridges near each end, like the bridges of a violin,
and tightened or relaxed with screw pins. The strings
must be tuned to one and the same note, and the
instrument placed in some current of air where the
wind can pass over its strings with freedom. A window,
the width of which is exactly equal to the length
of the harp, with the sash just raised to give the air admission,
is a good situation. When the wind blows upon
the strings, with various degrees of force, different musical
tones will be sounded; sometimes the blast brings
out all the tones in full concert, and sometimes it sinks
them to the softest murmur. In many old castles these
harps were fastened in the windows, and their wild music
caused the ignorant to think they were haunted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>A colossal imitation of the instrument just described
was invented at Milan, in 1786, by Abbate Gattoni. He
stretched seven strong iron wires, tuned to the notes of
the gamut, from the top of a tower sixty feet high, to the
house of a Signor Muscate, who was interested in the
success of the experiment and this apparatus, called the
giant’s harp, in blowing weather, yielded lengthened peals
of harmonious music. In a storm this music was sometimes
heard at the distance of several miles.</p>

<p>Simply tying waxed saddler’s silk to little sticks, and
pushing them into the crevices of windows, so as to receive
a draught of wind (the silk being strained tight),
will produce very sweet sounds.</p>


<h3>1.—THE MAGIC OF ACOUSTICS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> science of acoustics furnished the ancient sorcerers
with some of their most complete deceptions. The
imitation of thunder in their subterranean temples did
not fail to indicate the presence of a supernatural agent.
The golden virgins, whose ravishing voices resounded
through the temple of Delphos; the stone from the river
Pactolus, where trumpet notes scared the robber from the
treasure which it guarded; the speaking head, which
uttered its oracular responses at Lesbos; and the vocal
statue of Memnon, which began at the break of day to
accost the rising sun, were all deceptions derived from
science, and from a diligent observation of the phenomena
of nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>


<h3>2.—TO SHOW HOW SOUND TRAVELS
THROUGH A SOLID.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Take</span> a long piece of wood, such as the handle of a
broom, place a watch at one end, apply your ear to the
other, and the ticking will be distinctly heard.</p>


<h3>3.—THEORY OF THE VOICE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Provide</span> a species of whistle common as a child’s toy,
or a sportsman’s call, in the form of a hollow cylinder,
about three fourths of an inch in diameter, closed at both
ends by flat circular plates with holes in their centres.
Hold this toy between the teeth and the lips; blow through
it, and you can produce sounds, varying in pitch with the
force with which you blow. If the air be cautiously
graduated, all the sounds within the compass of a double
octave may be produced from it, and if great precaution
be taken in the management of the breath even deeper
tones may be brought out. This simple instrument or
toy, has indeed the greatest resemblance to the larynx,
which is the organ of the voice.</p>


<h3>4.—A SINGULAR EXAMPLE OF SUPERSTITION.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following <em>true story</em> was related to me by one who
was personally acquainted with the facts. There was a
certain bend in one of our western rivers which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
avoided by every one, as it was supposed to be haunted
by the devil. At a certain hour in the evening, for many
years, terrible curses were distinctly heard. Suddenly
they ceased. A gentleman skilled in the science of acoustics,
hearing an account of the strange phenomena, determined
to ascertain the cause, and carefully examined
the river on each side for about a mile above and below
the bend. He ascertained that at about the time the
sounds ceased, an old fisherman, who had lived on the
opposite side of the river, full a mile from the spot where
the curses were heard, had died. He was told that the
fisherman was in the habit of crossing the river to a village,
where he found a market for his fish, and where
he spent his money for liquor; and that after drinking
freely on his way home, while rowing across the river at
night, he would swear terribly. This gentleman then
persuaded a friend to go down the river to the place
where the curses were formerly heard, while he remained
in a boat on the river at the point at which the old man
usually crossed. He then played on a bugle and sang
several songs. His friend soon returned, and with eager
delight exclaimed, “O, ——, such glorious music fills
the air, just where the curses used to be heard!” The
neighbors came rushing down to hear it, and some fell
on their knees, praying. They said, “the angels have
driven the devil away.” Mr. —— then asked what were
the songs they heard. His friend described them correctly,
and said he understood even the words, one of
them being the famous Marseillaise, another a German
song; the foreign words made the ignorant more sure
that the sounds were supernatural. Mr. —— then played<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
on the bugle, and sang again the same songs, while his
friend stood by; but his friend said the music was not
equal to that he had heard below, where the sounds had
really seemed heavenly.</p>

<p>The peculiar configuration of the river banks had concentrated
the sounds, and the distance and the water had
softened them.</p>

<p>The person who related this anecdote to me said that
he and his friend had often tried the experiment. Nothing
would convince the more ignorant neighbors that the
sounds were occasioned by merely natural causes. A
love of the supernatural is strong within us, and sometimes
leads us into grave mistakes.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span>, as a nation, are not a happy, home-loving people.
The “spirit of unrest” pervades all classes.</p>

<p>This enterprising, uneasy spirit, has been, and is of
benefit to us, as a comparatively new country, in settling
and breaking our wild western lands.</p>

<p>But the time has come when it is well to curb that
spirit, and cultivate all quiet, home-loving influences.</p>

<p>Therefore we beseech you, parents, to begin in earliest
infancy to cultivate a love of the beautiful in nature;
give your little ones flowers; and as soon as they are
able to play in the garden, give them a little spot of their
own to dig in; and when they can understand the process,
give them seeds to plant, and some few flowers to cultivate.
We can tell you of a happy cottage home, where
the children, from earliest infancy, have lived among
flowers. Each had their tiny garden, with spade,
hoe, trowel, and watering-pot. The father and mother
would also assist with their own hands in training vines,
roses, and shrubs, in artistic beauty. The good father
never went to his counting-room without some flowers in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
his hand, or in the button-hole of his coat, the valued
gift from the tiny garden of one of his darlings. Years
passed and fortune favored them, but they never would
exchange their cottage home, with its vines, trees, and
shrubs, for all the stately mansions in the town. And as
the daughters married, and the sons left to seek their
fortunes, they would look back with intense longing to
their loved home; and joyous were their meetings around
the home Christmas tree.</p>

<p>On Sundays they always, even in midwinter, ornamented
their social table with flowers, for they are God’s
smiles. Therefore, my friends, we speak from observation,
and from seeing the effect of an opposite course.
If you wish to lessen your doctor’s bill, and give the
beauty of robust health and happiness to your children,
girls or boys, give them a garden, and let them plant,
weed, and water it. If your children bring you even a
simple field daisy, express your pleasure to them, and let
them not see you cast it aside.</p>

<p>A well cared for garden displays—and displays to
good advantage too—the love of home, domestic taste,
a wish to please, industry, neatness, taste, and all the
sweet household virtues that create a <em>happy</em> home.</p>

<p>Horticulture confines itself to no rank, and it may form
the amusement or the pursuit alike of great and
small, rich and poor; only the kind of garden we
choose, and what we do with it, must depend on our
circumstances.</p>

<p>Teach your boys the use of a pruning-knife, and how
to graft; then give them some trees to experiment upon.
You may save them from dissipation, by giving them a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
taste for horticulture. It is a happy, health-giving
employment.</p>

<p>Decorate even your barn with graceful vines. The
poorest house can be made an agreeable place by transplanting
a few of the many simple wild vines. It is not
natural to love intensely a stiff, ungainly object.</p>

<p>We have often thought, as we have roamed about the
farming districts of New England, and have seen the
many great, stiff, square houses, with not a graceful tree
or flower to relieve their nakedness (though now and then
a syringa, or lilac bush, or cinnamon rose, and perhaps a
stately old butternut, may be seen), the sons and daughters
of those households will surely emigrate. Utility is
our hobby. Some farmers think it waste time to plant a
flower, as it yields no fruit.</p>

<p>Remember the old saying, “All work and no play
makes Jack a dull boy.” You that dwell in a city, strive
to have a small spot in the country to which you may
send your children in summer, to roam at will. We
heard a little child, in urging her mother to go into the
country in vain, cry out, “It is too, <em>too bad</em>, mamma.
We know God did not make the city for little children,
because he loves us.”</p>

<p>Do not waste your money at fashionable watering-places.
Even in early years, take your children to the
woods and let them see nature in its wild state. There
is nothing like a day in the woods for refreshing us all,
in body and mind. The wild music of running brooks
is so lulling, the birds carol their “native wood-notes
wild” so sweetly, the strange blended odor of the damp
mould, the leaves, the wild flowers, and the prospect of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the distant meadow, are so delightful; the play of the
sunlight through the dense foliage, and on the sylvan
walks, is so beautiful, and the quiet is so marked, after
the hum and roar of a city, that the mind is tranquillized,
and both you and your children will be nearer to God,
and nearer to one another, for every hour thus spent.
Our whole country is full of wild beauty. Spend your
spare money in decorating your homes with trees, flowers,
and shrubs. The influence upon your children will be
far more beneficial.</p>

<p>If your children wish for money to purchase seeds and
flowers for their gardens, if possible, give it cheerfully.
It is far better so spent, than in dress and toys. Let
them plan their own gardens, and experiment as much as
they please. A very pretty fence can be made round such
gardens by a number of stakes of equal lengths, pointed
at one end to drive into the ground, square at the top,
and painted green. Then place them at equal distances
around your garden, and bore holes about six or seven
inches apart for the twine, which should be brown linen.
Pass the twine through the holes, in lines all around the
garden. Plant vines which run rapidly, such as Cypress
Vine, Madeira Vine, Nasturtium, Maurandya, Barclayanna,
Dwarf Convolvulus, Mountain Fringe, &amp;c. By
midsummer your simple fence will be very beautiful.</p>

<p>Having spent many years in cultivating flowers, perhaps
a few practical directions from our own experience
may be of service to our readers. And we will give
some excellent suggestions taken from a famous florist.</p>

<h3>1.—HOW TO PLANT SEEDS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> often think, because the seed we plant does not
germinate, that we have purchased poor seed, when the
fault is in the manner of planting.</p>

<p>Nearly all kinds of flower seeds require transplanting,
therefore it is best to plant in boxes, pots, or hot-beds.
Old cigar boxes are convenient, and are easily handled,
but first bore holes in the bottom of the boxes, and in
your pots or boxes place either broken clam or oyster
shells, or pieces of old flower pots, as a drainage; then
take light, rich earth and sift it or rub it carefully in
your hands, to be sure there are no lumps; some bake
the earth to destroy any insects which may be in it, but
it answers the same purpose to pour boiling water upon
it. After you have filled your boxes or pots with this
prepared earth, sprinkle your seed carefully over it, and
sift over them light soil sufficient to cover them, moisten
them with warm water, and place the box where there is
but little light, and throw a piece of paper over the top.
Some use a piece of thick flannel; if you use flannel,
water your seeds without removing it, until your seeds
have sprouted. A warm place will start them best.
Let them remain thus several days, till the seeds have a
chance to swell, before you give them much light, and
keep the earth moist (a sponge is excellent to water them,
as it does not disturb the position of the seeds; also use
warm water); as soon as you see they are sprouting,
give them light, and air, if not too cold, or else the plant
will not have strength to grow well. Hot-beds are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
best, and can be made with but little expense, by taking
some old box; and if you do not possess an old window-sash,
you can purchase one of some builder for a trifling
sum of money, and fit it to your box by nailing strips at
the sides; dig a place the size of the box, and two or
three feet deep; fill it with horse manure, mixed with
straw, which is the most heating; then sprinkle soil over
the top about six inches deep; place your box on the top,
carefully heaping the earth around the outside, and your
hot-bed is made, in which you can start your seeds and
slips by either placing your boxes or pots in the earth
on top of the manure, and plant your seeds and slips
in them, or as many prefer, planting in the soil of your
hot-bed. After your seedling plants are of sufficient
size to transplant, if you first transplant them into small
pots, you can easily plant them in your flower beds without
disturbing the roots, and the plants will not require
covering; you must first dig a hole and pour water into
it, then carefully slip the plant, dirt and all, from the pots,
and place into the hole made for it, and press the earth
tight around it. Of course they must remain in the pot
till they are well rooted. In raising slips, you need to
mix in full half common scouring sand with the soil, and
they must be shaded from the light several days.</p>

<p>All who care for flowers will desire to raise verbenas,
as they blossom all summer. If you wish to raise them
from seed, they should be sown in February or first of
March. One secret in raising fine verbenas is change of
soil. It would be better to plant them every year in a
different location, but if you renew the soil it will do to
plant them twice in the same bed, but never three years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
in succession. Indeed, flowers as well as vegetables need
constant change of soil; they soon exhaust the earth.
Seeds are better that are raised in locations distant from
the place where they are to be sown. Flowers soon deteriorate
if you continue to plant over and over from seed
raised in the same spot; that is one of the reasons why
seeds from Europe are generally preferred by florists.
Japan Pink seed should be planted in March, in order to
have them flower the first year; they are hardy and
blossom also the second year. Pansy seed should be
planted as early as Verbenas. Ten Weeks’ Stock, Phlox
Drummondi, Double Zinnias, Lobelia, Petunias, Portulaca,
Salpiglossis, Candytuft, Larkspur, &amp;c., should be
planted in April. If you desire to raise Picotee or Carnation
Pinks for the next year, and Canterbury Bells and
Fox Gloves, sow in April. Sow Asters of all kinds the
last of April or first of May. Some of the climbers,
such as Maurandya Barclayanna, Tropæolum, commonly
called Nasturtium, Cypress Vine, Thunbergia, &amp;c., need
transplanting, and better be sown early. Sweet Peas
should be sown in the open soil about three inches deep,
early in April. It is better to soak the seed in warm
water before sowing. When they have germinated, and
as they begin to climb, fill in earth around them, and
water now and then thoroughly with soap suds. Mignonnette
should not be transplanted; sow the seed in the
open soil the first of May. Candytuft and Sweet Alyssum
are hardy, and the seed can be sown out of doors;
but if you have once had them, they will come up self-sown.
Look over your beds in spring, and take up such
plants, when you have the soil prepared and beds made,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
then you can plant them back again where you desire.
Joseph’s Coat is a very brilliant plant; its leaves are all
shades of green, red, and yellow; the seed can be sown
either in or out of doors by the first of May, also Golden
Calliopsis. Balsams will grow better if the seeds are not
planted till the second week in May, out of doors.</p>

<p>All the flowers we have mentioned are desirable, even
in a small garden; of course there are hundreds of varieties
of even annuals, but unless you have a gardener it
is impossible to raise them all, for it is desirable, even in
a small garden, to have some flowers raised by slips, or
bought from some green-house, such as Fuchsias, Double
Feverfews, Scarlet Geraniums, Bouvardias, Heliotropes,
Rose Geraniums, Lemon Verbenas, Monthly Roses, Hardy
Perpetuals, &amp;c. Hardy Perpetual Roses are desirable in
every garden, they grow so thrifty and blossom all summer,
and with a little covering will live out all winter,
and if they are showered often, early in the spring, while
the dew is on the roses, with whale-oil soap suds, using
a syringe to shower them, it will prevent the usual damage
done by the slug. If you have a shady, moist place
in your garden, there you can plant your Lily of the
Valley, Double Blue English Violet, Forget-me-not, and
Pansy.</p>

<p>Fuchsias also require some shade. Heliotropes and
Geraniums will bear enriching more than most plants;
frequent waterings with guano water are excellent. A
table-spoonful of guano to a gallon of water is sufficiently
strong. It also improves Pansies, Fuchsias, and
nearly all plants except Roses. Soap suds is better
for Roses and Verbenas, at least according to our experience.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Nearly all plants make a finer show in a garden
arranged either in beds, each variety by itself, or in
clusters. Before planting your garden in spring, it is
well to carefully consider the nature of each flower, and
arrange your garden so that each flower can be displayed
to advantage; never plant promiscuously; it is astonishing
what a difference landscape gardening will make in
the general aspect of even a small place. It is quite as
desirable as to arrange the colors in a picture to harmonize.
Even an old stump of a tree can be made
beautiful by planting vines around it, or by scooping out
the top and filling in soil, and planting Nierembergia,
Lobelia, Double Nasturtium, Variegated Myrtle, &amp;c., in
it. Those we have mentioned blossom all summer, except
the Myrtle, the leaves of which are as beautiful as
many flowers.</p>

<p>If we ladies would spend less time on our dress and in
arrangements for the table, and take that time for working
in our gardens with our children, we should not only
make our homes more attractive, but we should gain in
health and strength. Early every spring call a family
council to decide the arrangement of your flower
garden. Let your boys have a place to raise vegetables
as a pastime. Encourage them to diligence by promising
to purchase all they will raise; in that way they can earn
money to give to the poor, or for their Christmas presents;
even children will take far more pleasure in giving
what they have really earned with their own hands.</p>

<h3>2.—THE QUEEN OF FLOWERS, THE ROSE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> beautiful flower deserves especial attention, and
is truly called the Poet’s flower. A rose is the type of
beauty in women. A lovely maiden is called a rose-bud.
A beautiful matron compared to a rose in full bloom.
Its delicate and refreshing perfume is always welcome to
an invalid. It adorns a bride, and is a tribute of love in
decorating the lifeless remains of our loved ones.</p>

<p>Volumes could be written upon the beauties of the
rose. A child can cultivate this beautiful flower. If
you do not possess any ground, there always will be room
for at least one pot with a rose in your own room.</p>

<p>Roses can be classified under three general heads.</p>

<h4>No. 1.</h4>

<p>Those that bloom only once in a season, such as Hybrid
China, Provence, Sweet and Austrian Briars, most
of the mosses, and all climbing varieties that are hardy
in New England and the Middle States. We do not
advise our young friends to cultivate this class, unless
they have large gardens. Madame Plantier is the only
variety which we retain in our garden. This rose is
a profuse bloomer, and one of the most perfect white
roses grown. We will mention some of the desirable
climbing varieties which can be used for “Pillar Roses.”</p>

<ul><li>Queen of the Prairies, deep rose color.</li>
<li>Baltimore Belle, blush white, blooming in large</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>clusters.</li>
<li>Russeliana, crimson shaded to pink.</li>
<li>Madame d’Arblay, creamy white.</li>
<li>Gem of the Prairies, carmine, blotched white, very</li>
<li>full.</li>
<li>Superba, flesh color, clusters immense.</li></ul>

<h4>No. 2.<br />
THE HYBRID PERPETUALS, OR REMONTANTS.</h4>

<p>This desirable class is of comparatively recent origin,
and obtained by hybridizing the Provence and Damask
varieties with the Ever-blooming, or China. They in a
measure combine the qualities of the two classes, but
less of the China, as the name Perpetual is a misnomer,
for the chief blooming ones in regular season of rose
flowering, unless especial care is taken to cut off every
flower as soon as they begin to wither, and keep the plant
growing freely, then these plants will blossom twice or
thrice in a season. Most of these Remontants are full
bloomers, and the flowers very perfect. We will give a
list of a few varieties we can recommend.</p>

<ul>
<li>Auguste Mie, pale shade of rose, very full.</li>
<li>Baronne Provost, bright rose, very double.</li>
<li>Blanche Vibert, pure white, delicate grower.</li>
<li>Caroline de Sensal, blush, pink centre, free bloomer.</li>
<li>Géant des Batailles, reddish crimson, superb.</li>
<li>General Jacqueminot, bright crimson, very brilliant.</li>
<li>Jules Margottin, bright scarlet crimson.</li>
<li>Le Lion des Combats, <em>very dark</em> crimson purple.</li>
</ul>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<h4>No. 3.</h4>

<p>The monthly, or ever-blooming class, are distinguished
by their delicate shining leaves and stems. This class
comprises four sub-classes, namely, the Noisette, Tea,
Bengal, and Bourbon.</p>

<p>The Noisette are of rampant growth, usually flowering
in clusters. In the Southern States they need no covering
during the winter months, but in the North, East,
and West, if buried in winter, and properly trained,
they are often used as Pillar Roses, particularly the
beautiful La Marque, whose pure white buds are so valuable
to all florists. If planted in the ground in a green-house,
it will climb all over the walls. We will name
some varieties which we have cultivated, and know can
be successfully raised, even in New England.</p>

<p>There are comparatively but few varieties of roses
suitable for producing an abundance of flowers in winter,
and these would not be called the finest varieties for
summer culture. They are selected for their buds.
The Safrona for instance, is selected for its deep, saffron
colored buds; the full flower is but semi-double. We
will give the names of a few of the roses best adapted
for winter culture.</p>

<h4>CULTIVATION.</h4>

<p>The best soil for the rose is a rather stiff loam, although
it is not particular about soil, but grows luxuriantly,
flourishes well in a fresh loam with a plenty of
pure air and sunlight. A stiff, clay loam will produce
better flowers, and of a deeper color, than a soil of a
light muddy character. If you desire many blossoms, be
careful to cut off every rose when it fades away. We
gather our roses so freely, we leave but few to wither.
In the spring roses should be pruned thoroughly.</p>

<p>Many people have been discouraged in raising roses,
on account of the slug and other insects; but nothing
can flourish in this world, that is desirable, without care.
So with the rose. Early in spring, just as the buds are
starting, wash your roses in a solution of tobacco or
whale-oil soap. If the insects appear on the leaf, syringe
the bush freely, early in the morning or late at night, with
a solution of whale-oil soap. Sprinkle wood ashes or
charcoal dust around the roots.</p>

<p>A gardener invariably recommends monthly roses,
rather than the so-called perpetuals. Those who purchase
perpetuals, without a previous knowledge of their
habits, are always disappointed in the few flowers they
produce after the first blooming. Their great virtue is
the hardy nature of the plant. The monthly roses bloom
at the South nearly the whole year. But what shall we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
do with these delicate roses at the North during the winter?
The best way is to lay them down, and cover with
sods, or earth and manure. If the subsoil is gravelly or
sandy, they will surely keep, as a good drainage is necessary,
without it they cannot live. The way to lay
down a rose-bush is to dig a trench four or five inches
deep, up to the root of the rose, then bend your rose-bush
carefully into the trench, and peg it down. Cover
entirely root and branches by sods, placed grassy side
upwards, forming a hillock. Or cover it with earth or
sand, and straw or manure.</p>

<p>The next important consideration is <em>the time at which
it is done</em>. Few amateurs have any idea of the amount
of freezing which even the tender tea roses will sustain
without injury. It often proves fatal to roses to be covered
too soon. It is well to cover the ground around the
roots of the roses with leaves or straw to prevent the
earth from freezing. In New England, the early or middle
part of November is generally the time to cover roses
for the winter; in the Middle States, in December. The
best rule is to let your roses remain uncovered, until the
ground can no longer be ploughed, or dug with a spade.
This covering can be removed as soon as vegetation
fairly starts in spring. Every plant thus saved possesses
a four-fold value over those planted out in the spring, as
the roots have been so little disturbed. Another way is
to dig a trench, line it with straw, and lay in your delicate
roses, then cover entirely with earth until spring.
Roses that have bloomed all summer should not be potted
for winter use. They need rest, and will not flourish in
warm rooms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<h4>ROSES FOR WINTER BLOOMING.</h4>

<p>Roses for winter blooming require a different treatment,
as one essential condition of free winter flowering
is, that the plant has abundance of active, or, as gardeners
term them, “working roots.” Plants are started for this
purpose either by cuttings struck in March, or else one
year old plants are used. These plants should be re-potted
frequently to prevent their becoming pot-bound.
They must never be allowed to dry or wilt in the heat
of summer, else the white, working roots will perish,
and before the plant can regain its vigor new ones must
be formed. You must not attempt to force your rose at
first; when you take it in for winter, a cool temperature
will be needful. It depends upon when you desire rosebuds
how you treat it. It must be pruned previous to
flowering. If you desire roses the first of January,
prune or shorten the shoots the first of November (earlier
for Christmas). They then can be placed in temperature
ranging fifty degrees to sixty degrees at night, with
only fifteen degrees higher during the day. Two year
old plants are better for new beginners, as they form
working roots sooner, having more fibres.</p>

<p>In the summer the plants should be exposed to the
sun; but to keep them from drying, place the pots in
beds of sawdust, or refuse hops, tan, bark, or sand,
whichever is most convenient to obtain.</p>

<h4>PREPARATION.</h4>

<p>Our young friends may desire to raise their own roses,
so we will give them a few directions. The best time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
to take cuttings is from October to January. The wood
must be ripened; cuttings are usually made with three
or four eyes. These cuttings are best put into a cold
frame, or in a box prepared with equal parts of sand, leaf
mould, and loam; all they require is sufficient protection
not to freeze. Cuttings placed in such frames about the
last of October, will be rooted sufficient to pot by March.
Cuttings can be placed in rows quite near together, say
an inch apart, and the rows three inches apart. This
space allows you to press the soil firmly about each stem.
One thorough watering, when put in, to settle the soil
closely around them, will usually be all that is necessary
until they begin to root in the spring. Some varieties
will root much easier than others. As soon as they are
well rooted, they should be potted in two inch pots,
shaded and watered for a few days, and gradually hardened
off by exposing them to the air; in this way they
can be sufficiently rooted to plant in the open ground in
April or May. Layering is more easily done from about
the middle of June to the middle of September, always
using shoots of the young growth—that is, a growth
of three or four weeks old, or such as are not so much
ripened as to drop the leaves; or in other words, the cut
should always be made at that part of the shoot where
there are as green and healthy leaves below as above the
cut. This condition of the shoot is very important, in
order to produce a well-rooted layer.</p>

<p>Another mode of layering, not in general use, is, to
place the layer where the incision is made, in a three or
four inch pot, sinking the pot in the ground to the level
of the rim; all the roots being confined in the pot, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the layer is lifted, no check is given to them. Layers so
made may be planted out in the fall, and if a little mulching
is given round the roots, not one plant in a hundred
will fail; while if the layering is done in the usual way,
without pots, a heavy percentage is almost certain to be
lost during the winter. To the florist, without proper
means of propagation, this method of layering roses in
pots will be found very advantageous, as every layer so
made will make an excellent flowering plant by spring,
if kept in a green-house or cold-pit, during the winter,
and will prove nearly as valuable to the purchaser as
large one year old plants.</p>

<h4>ROSE-BEDS.</h4>

<p>Before planting a rose, be sure to find out its nature,
or you may have a tall bush where you would desire a
low shrub-growing rose. In arranging rose-beds, plant
the tall standards in the centre. Then a row of high
bush growing roses, then a row of half dwarfs, then a
row of dwarf-growing roses. If this selection of the
roses in such a bed is properly made, it will be pleasant
to the eye from June to October. Of course the roses
should be chiefly monthlies, or free-blowing perpetuals.</p>


<h3>3.—FLOWER BEDS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are a great variety of opinions as regards the
most effective way of planting flower beds. Some prefer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
to mix plants of different colors and varieties; others
prefer the ribbon style of planting, now so generally seen
in Europe.</p>

<p>If the promiscuous style is adopted, care should be
taken to dispose the plants in the beds, so that the tallest
plants will be at the back of the bed; if the leader is
against a wall or background of shrubbery, the others
graduating to the front, according to the height. In
open beds, on the lawn, the tallest should be in the centre,
the others grading down to the front, on all sides,
interspersing the colors so as to form the most agreeable
contrast in shades. But for grand effect, nothing, in our
estimation, can ever be produced in promiscuous planting
to equal that obtained by planting in masses or in
ribbon lines. In Europe the lawns are cut so as to resemble
rich green velvet; on these the flower beds are
laid out in every style one can conceive; some are planted
in masses of blue, scarlet, yellow, crimson, white, &amp;c.,
separate beds of each, harmoniously blended on the carpeting
of green. Then again the ribbon style is used
in the large beds, in forms so various that allusion can
here be made to only a few of the most conspicuous.</p>

<p>In a circular bed, say of twenty feet in diameter, the
bordering can be of blue. Lobelia, attaining a height
of six inches; next plant Mrs. Pollock Geranium (this
does not grow very thrifty out of doors in New England),
or Bijou Zonale Geranium, growing about nine
inches high. If you plant Mrs. Pollock, on the next
row to it plant Mountain of Snow Geranium; if the
Bijou plant, a circle of the red-leaved Achyranthus;
there are several varieties of this plant. Next the Coleus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Verschaffeltii; the centre being a mound of Scarlet Salvia.
Another style is to edge the bed with Alternanthera
Spothalata (leaves pink and crimson), which grows low
and thick for a border. Then the fern-like, white-leaved
Centaurea Gymnocarpa; next row, the Crystal Palace
Scarlet Geranium. Then Phalaris Arundinacea Picta, a
new style of ribbon grass; next Coleus Verschaffeltii; in
the centre a clump of Coma or Pampas Grass.</p>

<p>There are a great many different ways of arranging
these ribboned beds. It is pleasant to exercise one’s own
taste, therefore we only give examples to teach our readers
how such beds can be prepared.</p>

<p>Narrow beds along the margins of walks, ribbon lines
can be formed of low-growing plants, such as the White
Lobelia Snow-flake, or Gypsophilia, or Silver Leaved
Alyssum for the front line, followed next by Tom
Thumb Trapæolum; then, as a centre, or third line,
Fuchsia, golden fleeced; as a second marginal line on
the other side, Bijou Zonale Geranium, white-leaved,
with scarlet flowers, followed by a line of Blue Lobelia.
Shaded stars have a fine effect on a lawn; cut a star, and
plant it either with Verbenas, Petunias, Phlox Drummondii,
or Portulaca. The ends of the stars should be
white, and shaded to the centre, which should be dark,
each point having different colors, one shade of purple,
one shade of pink, one shade of red, then shades of
lilac, then shades of scarlet. The centre the darkest
shades. There are many pretty ways of forming the
beds of a small garden. We append one diagram of a
garden, and the flowers to plant it with according to our
taste.</p>

arranged with standards in the centre, as we have described,
might be prepared for the centre bed A, and the
Salvia, &amp;c., planted in the bed H, in place of the roses.</p>


<h3>4.—CARNATIONS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> cultivation of the Carnation is very simple. It
is rooted from cuttings at any time from October to April,
and as the plant is almost hardy, it may be planted in
early spring with safety in the open ground. It is safe
to put them out as soon as cabbage plants are set out.
Many from ignorance keep their Carnations in a pot or
green-house until the last of May, thereby losing six
weeks’ growth.</p>

<p>The Carnation cannot flourish in a wet soil, and care
should be taken to secure good drainage. As the Carnation
grows, if winter flowering is desired, the young
shoots that the plant throws out should be cut off; this
induces a steady growth. There are many fine varieties
for summer growth, and but few suitable for winter flowering.</p>


<h3>5.—FUCHSIAS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">These</span> flowers are very easily cultivated from slips;
any amateur florist can make these slips grow, either by
planting in wet sand, or in a bottle of water. Their
lovely and graceful flowers add to every bouquet. They
require rich light soil, such as decayed leaves and peat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
moist atmosphere, and shade. Like the Lemon Verbena,
the plants will keep all winter in a cellar. There are
but few varieties that bloom well in winter. Bianca Marginata,
white, with crimson corolla. Speciosa, flesh-colored,
with scarlet corolla (this variety will bloom the
year round, if well cared for). Serratifolia, greenish
sepals, with orange scarlet corolla. These are recommended
for winter flowering by all florists. We will
mention a few varieties for summer culture.</p>

<p>Elm City, crimson, very double. Venus de Medicis,
white, magenta corolla. Rose of Castille, sepals white,
corolla violet rose. Snowdrop, sepals bright scarlet,
corolla white, semi-double. Striata Perfecta, double
striped blue and crimson. Queen of Whites, double
white corolla. Charming, violet corolla, crimson sepals,
clusters immense. Lady of the Sea, corolla violet purple,
flowers two inches in diameter.</p>


<h3>6.—PANSIES.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Who</span> does not love a pansy? They are easily raised
by seed and layers. The seeds should be planted in
March for summer culture, and in October for winter
use. The pansy requires a rich soil.</p>

<p>The finest bed of English pansies we ever saw were
planted in the fall, in a bed of rich soil. Before the
winter snows the plants were covered lightly with manure
and straw through the winter. In the spring the
manure was carefully raked off, and the plants dug
around with a garden fork. They bloomed early in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
spring; and, as we looked upon them by the morning
light, their bright faces seemed to say “Good morning!”
These lovely flowers look like happy children.</p>

<p>Many persons in our country call the pansy, violet;
but the gardener only calls the sweet double blue and
white violet by that name. And this sweet violet hides
its head modestly under its leaves, and is the flower the
poet speaks of,—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Meek and lowly, hiding ’neath its leaves of green.”</p>
</div>

<p>The bright-faced pansy does not hide its head; it looks
you in the face as fearless as a sinless child. These violets
are in great demand from their delicious perfume.
These plants require shade and moisture. The best varieties
are the “double blue Neapolitan” Setsenbran,
single blue, very prolific. King of Violets, very large
blue. Double white Neapolitan; this does not bloom
freely. Sweet-scented Geraniums, Heliotrope, Lantanas,
Lemon Verbena, &amp;c., are all easily propagated from slips.
The three first require often watering with guano water,
and with this treatment will fully repay all care.</p>


<h3>7.—HOW TO PLANT HARDY BULBS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">October</span>, or the early part of November, is the time to
plant bulbs for next year’s flowering. Bulbs can be
raised in any sunny place, no matter how small the bed
may be; they require less care, for the beauty of the
flower, than any other class of plants. We will give
some plain and simple directions, hoping our young readers
may be induced to plant at least a few bulbs this fall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>The soil for bulbs should be rich and well drained; it
should also be dug deep. If water should lie on the surface
long the bulbs would rot. If the soil is poor, enrich
it with well-rotted stable manure, or with surface
earth from the woods, or decayed leaves. Cow manure,
of course, is the best. If the ground is stiff, and the
manure fresh, it is well to put a little sand around each
bulb. If the soil has too much clay, mix sand with the
manure.</p>

<p>It is well to have your beds made so narrow that the
weeds can be destroyed, and the ground kept mellow,
without walking among the plants. Before the heavy
frosts of winter appear your bulb beds should be protected
with leaves. Over these throw a little brush, to
prevent the wind from uncovering your bulbs. If your
bulbs have been planted a year or two, cover them with
manure in the fall; the flowers in the spring will repay
you for all expense and trouble.</p>

<p>Hyacinths and tulips should be planted about six
inches apart, the hyacinth four inches deep, and the tulip
three inches. The early varieties will often blossom the
latter part of March. Crocuses blossom even earlier.
They should be planted about three inches apart, and
two inches deep. Snowdrops—the first flower of spring—should
be planted in the same way as the crocus, or a
little nearer together. Narcissuses, including the daffodil
and jonquil, should be planted in the same manner as the
hyacinth. All these bulbs can be planted in beds where
you may desire to place either seedlings or any other
annual, which will blossom after these bulbs have done
flowering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>It is best to take up all your bulbs every third year,
when they are done flowering, and separate the newly-formed
bulbs from the old. Keep them in a dry place
till October, then replant as we have directed.</p>


<h3>8.—JAPAN LILIES.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> all the valuable flowers that have been imported
from Japan or China, during the past twenty years, nothing
equals the exquisitely beautiful Japan Lily—<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lilium
Lancifolium</i>. No description can do anything like justice
to these flowers, or show the beautiful, frost-like white
of the surface, glistening like dew-drops; or the rubies
that stand out on the surface of one of the varieties, while
the end of the leaf is shaded like the exquisite pink, or
the inside of some sea-shells from India.</p>

<p>There are nine varieties. The pure white and crimson,
Lancifolium Monstrosum rubrum; the pure white
Lancifolium Monstrosum album, and a delicate rose of
the same variety; then the dark crimson, Lilium Melpomene;
white, spotted with delicate salmon, Lilium Punctatum;
the pure white, with projecting glistening spots,
called Lilium Lancifolium album; Lilium Lancifolium
rubrum, white ground, spotted with crimson; Lilium
Lancifolium roseum, shaded and spotted with rose; and
Lilium auratum. This is sometimes called Golden-banded
Lily, and is truly the king of the lilies. The flower is
ten to twelve inches across, composed of six delicate
white ivory parts, each thickly studded with crimson
spots, with a golden band through its centre. In addition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
to the beauty of these lilies, they are fragrant, and as
hardy as any of our common varieties.</p>

<p>Strong bulbs send up flowering stems from three to five
feet in height, and begin to bloom about the middle of
August. Each flowering stem will have from two to a
dozen flowers, according to the strength of the bulb.</p>

<p>Rich garden soil is all that is needed for these lilies.
Plant them in October or early in November, about a
foot apart, and five inches deep. The bulbs should remain
several years, if possible, without removal. These
must be the lilies that surpassed Solomon in all his glory.
Lilium Longiflorum is called very beautiful. The flowers
are snow-white, trumpet-shaped flowers. Lilium
Brownii, new variety, superb white.</p>


<h3>9.—CAPE BULBS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">These</span> are so called from coming from the Cape of
Good Hope. The Gladiolus is the finest variety. These
bulbs are easily cultivated in New England and the Middle
States; they can be planted out as soon as all fear
of frost is passed. They will bloom by the last of July,
and by making successive plantings every two weeks to
the middle of July, they can be had in perfection until
the frost returns. Although they are not particular
about soil, yet if choice can be had, a sandy loam, peat,
or a soil of decomposed leaves, is better than a stiff clay
soil.</p>

<p>In any soil, if it is well enriched, the flowers will increase
in size and beauty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>These bulbs should be taken up as soon as the stems
begin to wither in the fall; but should the stalk of the
late plantings be yet green, the bulbs should be left adhering
to the stalk until dried, which will ripen off the
bulbs. They can be kept in winter under the stage of a
green-house, or in a frost-proof cellar or closet, or in
any dry place where potatoes will keep. It is impossible
to mention varieties; all are good, and new varieties
increase yearly.</p>


<h3>10.—HOW TO GROW BULBS IN WINTER.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Bulbs</span> can be grown in vases, bowls, dishes, cornucopias,
&amp;c., of whatsoever shape or form, from the small
ornament that will hold a crocus, to the large family
punch-bowl, capable of growing a dozen hyacinths.
Wire or rustic work of any kind, lined or not with zinc,
and filled with moss, will grow bulbs to perfection. A
zinc frame can be made to fill the whole front of any
window; and if filled with moss or sand, and planted
with hyacinths, lily of the valley, crocuses, snow-drops,
tulips, narcissus, and polyanthus, would in itself form a
complete miniature winter flower-garden. These, with
successive plantings, may be made so many connecting
links between our autumn flowers and the early spring
blossoms.</p>

<p>Take a common soup plate, place in it as many strong
bulbs as it will hold easily, and fill in about half an inch
of water. In a few days the roots begin to spread, and
so clasp each other in the course of a few weeks, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
they form a natural support. If the bulbs and plate are
covered with moss, it improves the appearance. For
winter bloom successive plantings can be made every two
weeks, from September till January. After the early
part of December, hyacinths intended for glasses had
better be half grown in pots, then turned out and the
roots carefully freed from the soil in tepid water, then
placed in glasses. In this way they will blossom sooner.
The soil used to cultivate bulbs should be light and rich,
full half sand. Bulbs can be grown in moss by keeping
it damp. They can be raised even in clear sand. Take
any ornamental dish capable of holding moisture, and
fill it with sand in a pyramidal form. In the centre
plant a hyacinth, and at equal distances round it plant
three or more, according to the size of the dish; fill up
the space with crocuses, snow-drops, dwarf tulips, &amp;c.
In planting, the bulbs should be covered with sand, all
but the tops. Then place the dish of bulbs in water five
minutes, in order to fix the bulbs firmly in their position.
Repeat this bath once a week, never allowing the sand
to become dry. Place it in the dark for two weeks, then
keep it in a cool, light, airy room.</p>

<p>There is no bulb so well adapted to house culture as
the hyacinth. They grow easily in pots or glasses.
They will grow in almost any light, sandy soil; but just
in proportion as this is adapted to the plant, will the perfection
of their culture be attained.</p>

<p>For pot growing, the hyacinth, to attain its greatest
beauty, should be grown in pots seven inches in diameter,
and the same depth. They will grow and blossom
in pots of four or five inches in diameter. Only one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
bulb should be planted in a pot. Two or three can be
grown in larger sized pots. Put over the hole in the
bottom a good drainage, half an inch or more in depth,
on this either a handful of leaf mould, very old cow
manure, or the coarse part of the compost; then add the
prepared soil, filling up the pot to within an inch of the
top. On this place the bulb, covering it with soil all but
the top; press the earth gently around it, and shake the
pot slightly, to settle the soil, and finish with a good watering;
then either plunge the pots three or four inches
in some old hot-bed, and cover with leaves, or place
them in the dark, covered carefully, but in a dry place,
for several weeks, to allow the roots to make a vigorous
start. Water them very slightly at first, then gradually
inure them to the sunlight. As the flowers expand, place
a saucer under each pot, which must be kept filled with
water till the flowers begin to decay; then lessen the
water till withheld entirely.</p>

<p>For planting in glasses, the last of October or early in
November will do. Use only rain or spring water. Fill
the glasses with water, and place the bulb so that the
roots will just come in contact with it; set them in a
dark closet, or on a shelf in a dry cellar, and let them
remain till the roots have started, usually in three or
four weeks; then remove them to any place which is
well lighted and warm, keeping them from the sun till
they look a deep green; turn them around now and then,
and change the water once in three or four weeks. If
you perceive the roots look slimy, and the water fetid,
carefully remove the bulb, and place the roots in clear
water of the same temperature; wash the roots gently;
cleanse the glass before replacing the bulb.</p>

<h3>11.—GARDEN INSECTS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> presenting this subject to our readers, it will be
difficult to decide where to begin, or where to leave off.
With the first warmth, aphides, or plant lice, in shoals
and nations, show their unwelcome presence on our roses,
geraniums, and almost all choice plants. Many of our
choice fruit trees are infested with these pests of the garden.
They are exceedingly prolific. Réaumur has
proved that one of these insects, in five generations, may
become the progenitor of nearly six thousand millions of
descendants. They fasten themselves in crowds on a
plant, and suck the life from it. Some live in the ground
and infest the roots of plants, such as verbenas and China
asters. We have often, on seeing a plant drooping,
saved it by taking up the plant, root and all, and washing
it in strong soap suds; replant it, after carefully
scalding the earth, and digging it in. The plant should
be protected from the sun for a few days, until the roots
start again.</p>

<p>The best remedy for these plant lice is to syringe them
with a solution of whale-oil soap, or a mixture of soap
suds and tobacco water, used warm. Still another remedy
is a solution of half an ounce of strong carbonate
of ammonia in a quart of water. Where it is possible,
dip the infected branches into either of the above solutions,
holding them carefully in the solution several
minutes.</p>

<p>A drying east wind makes insects abound, and rain
clears them away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>The rose-chafers, or rose-bugs appear about the second
week in June, and remain thirty or forty days. They
infest rose bushes and grape vines. They must be carefully
picked or brushed off into a basin of hot water, or
burned, as they increase thirty fold, and destroy both
fruit and flower.</p>

<p>Caterpillars of many butterflies and moths are destructive
in a garden, and, when the perfect insects can be
caught, before they lay their eggs, one death will save
much killing. Whenever one is found resting quietly on
a branch, stem, or leaf, with the wings folded, it is most
likely a female about to lay her eggs, and it had better
be killed. If a butterfly or moth is found so placed,
dead, she will have laid her eggs; be sure to find and
destroy them. As the season advances, destroy every
chrysalis you find.</p>

<p>Possibly some of our young readers have never seen a
chrysalis, and may not know what it is. We will try
and explain this to you. Every species of the butterfly,
or moth, is first a grub or caterpillar, crawling upon, or
in the earth. These caterpillars, when they have completed
the feeding stage, retire to some place of concealment,
under a leaf, beneath palings, or in interstices of
walls, spin a tuft of silky fibre, and entangle the hooks
of their hindmost feet in it. Then they form a loop, to
sustain the fore part of the body in a horizontal or vertical
position. Then they spin a band over the back; and
most caterpillars form a cocoon, in the shape of the letter
U, around the body. Then they cast off the caterpillar
skin, and become a chrysalis. In summer the
chrysalis state lasts from eleven to fifteen days. Later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
it lasts all winter (while in this state these insects
remain dormant). At the proper time the chrysalis
bursts open, and a butterfly issues from it. We have
often found these cocoons, or chrysalides, and taken
them to our rooms to watch the coming forth of the
butterfly.</p>

<p>Rose slug (Lelandin Rosæ), a light green, translucent
little fellow, varying from one sixteenth of an inch to
nearly an inch in length. There are evidently two
species or varieties, one of which confines its ravages to
the lower side of the leaf, the other eats it entire. The
first is by far the most destructive here. In a few days
after the plants are attacked they appear as if they had
been burned.</p>

<p>The only remedy we have found is a preventive one,
which, in fact, ought to be used against all insect life.
We have spoken of this (and will not repeat) in our
rose chapter. The only remedy, whale-oil soap, is prepared
by florists by dissolving one pound to eight gallons
of water. They apply it <em>ten</em> days in succession, with a
garden engine or syringe. This must be done very early
in the morning, or late at night, as the slug shuns the
light of day, and hides under the leaf. With very young,
delicate roses, the solution is too powerful; hand work
will be necessary to pick them off. English sparrows, a
comparatively late importation, should be kindly treated
by all, as they are the best exterminators of injurious
insects. The ground, or blue aphis, and verbena mite,
are among our most subtle and dangerous of pests.
They work at the root, and often before we can see the
plant fading, they have taken its life. The florist’s remedy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
is as soon as you see the least sign of drooping in
your Asters or Verbenas, the plants most afflicted by
them, water them copiously and persistently at the
roots, with tobacco water, the color of strong tea, and
apply it daily for one week. We often take up the plants
and wash the roots, but it is a harsh remedy: it will kill
or cure.</p>


<h3>12.—SOME USEFUL HINTS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have, in studying different books on horticulture,
found many opposing sentiments. Some seemed like
hearsay to all former experience, yet we ought to be
ready to receive all advice based upon positive experience.
We intend acting upon some new theories of
Peter Henderson, a famous gardener near New York.
We have always supposed it very injurious to take water
directly from a cold spring to water plants, and that rain
water or soft water must be used, at the same temperature
as the air in which the plants are growing. He says
it is a foolish dogma, as the water will take the same
temperature before the plant can be injured. Of course
if the plant was to stand in cold water it would injure it.
This will save much extra trouble; we ourselves shall
profit by his advice, as he ought to know, having faithfully
tried the experiment.</p>

<p>We have always supposed it necessary for the health of
a potted plant to have a sufficient amount of bits of
oyster shell, &amp;c., at the bottom for drainage.</p>

<p>Mr. Henderson says, for fifteen years he has grown all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
his thrifty plants <em>without</em> the use of crock, charcoal, or
any other substitute, and he considers it useless trouble;
he thinks the moisture escapes freely from the sides of
the pot. He says when we wish to resuscitate an unhealthy
plant, we wash the soil from its roots, and put
in a <em>new</em> pot, where the drainage is perfect from the
sides. He has grown <em>millions</em> of healthy plants without
draining. He thinks old pots, whose pores are all filled,
often cause the death of a plant. He approves of frequent
change of pots, as it injures a plant for the roots
to become hard and woody. In most cases the slightest
tap on the edge of the pot is sufficient to turn out the
ball of earth. Be careful and not take too large a pot;
the size must increase gradually.</p>

<p>Mr. Henderson thinks it is not unhealthy to sleep with
plants in the room, as we have always been taught. He
says it is a common practice for gardeners to sleep in
their green-house, and to be with their plants often at
night, and yet, as a class, they are vigorous men. He
himself, for three winters, slept on the floor of the hot-house,
without any injury, and that was more than a
score of years ago.</p>

<p>Plants can easily be sent by mail, by first washing the
roots in water, then take them dripping and wrap them
in dry moss, then roll around them several thicknesses
of thick brown paper; the whole must be <em>tightly</em> rolled,
to prevent the dry air penetrating to shrivel the plant.
In this way plants can be sent even two thousand miles
at a cheap rate, as our postal laws only charge two cents
for four ounces, unless the package exceeds four pounds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>


<h3>13.—MOSS BASKETS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Take</span> a piece of the spring used in hoop-skirts, or a
rattan, and make a small hoop about eight inches in
diameter. Collect from the woods a quantity of the
long, feathery moss, and wind a heavy wreath of this
moss on a hoop, then cover a piece of the rattan or hoop-spring,
sufficiently long for the handle, with moss, and
fasten it to the hoop. Then take a solid bunch of this
moss, the size of the centre of the hoop, and push inside
of this moss-covered hoop; this forms a moss basket.
Take a common plate, and place this basket upon it, and
sprinkle it thoroughly with water. This basket can be
filled again and again with bright flowers, casting away
the flowers as they wither. The wet moss will keep
them fresh as long as if placed in a vase filled with
water. Now and then place this basket in a dish of
water, and sprinkle it, or let the rain fall upon it. This
will freshen the green tint of the moss.</p>

<p>Baskets covered with the knitted moss, which in our
work department we have given the directions how to
prepare, are very pretty. A tin dish should be made to
fit it, and painted green; keep this filled with natural
flowers, or French artificial flowers, which imitate nature
perfectly, can be arranged in them, and if placed on a
bracket, or in some place where they will not be likely to
be examined too closely, they will easily pass for fresh
flowers.</p>

<p>To form a pyramid of flowers, take three, four, or five
wooden bowls, according to the size you wish for your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
pyramid; let them be a regular gradation in size; procure
some round pieces of wood, like ribbon blocks,
graded in size, glue the tallest into the centre of the
largest bowl so that it will stand upright, and up on
top of that glue the bowl next in size, and so on to the
smallest bowl. Varnish the inside several coats; paint
the outsides green, and cover with moss; some have a
stand made, and glued to the bottom of the largest bowl.
When filled with flowers it is a lovely sight. Baskets
made of tin and painted green, then covered with moss,
make the prettiest hanging baskets possible. Tin rings,
large enough to surround vases placed inside, and made
to hold water, with little wires across the top and painted
green, when filled with flowers, form the prettiest mats
in the world; the wires keep the flowers in place. I
saw one filled with only rosebuds, blue forget-me-nots,
and geranium leaves. It is an improvement to cover
the outside with moss. Crosses made in the same way
are very beautiful, and are appropriate to place on the
grave of any beloved friend. In that way flowers can be
preserved a long time, if there is a sufficient supply of
water to preserve them.</p>

<p>There are innumerable ways of arranging flowers.
The poorest person can afford to purchase a tin basin,
and with a little common paste and moss, which can be
found in all country places, a pretty dish for flowers is
soon made. Shells make lovely vases. The large shells
sailors polish so exquisitely to resemble mother of pearl,
make elegant hanging vases; bore holes on each side and
hang them with strong cords.</p>

<p>The month of September is not too late to make a fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
collection of mosses from mountains and valleys. Mosses
will have attained by this time a luxurious growth.
There are but few mosses that look well after being
pressed. The best way to preserve a collection of mosses
is to arrange them in some suitable box, as they grow,
and in the order you desire to keep them, and let them
dry slowly. If you wish to cover any box, basket, or
vase, it is better to paste them on, before they are
entirely dry, with common paste. The dry white and
gray mosses form very beautiful receptacles for flowers,
by covering the outside of any rustic basket with the
moss. Thread wire will fasten it firmly to any basket,
or rustic work. Paste or wire can be used to fasten it
on to boxes or bowls.</p>

<p>We have seen a lovely rustic stand for flowers, formed
from a common wooden box (a large bowl is the more
desirable). The handle was formed from a barrel hoop.
The legs of the stand were made of gnarled branches of
trees. Then fine annealed wire was wound over the
whole. This served to hold the moss firmly to the box.
The beautiful curled white, gray, and green dry mosses
were then arranged all over the box, legs, and handle, so
as to give grace and beauty to this inexpensive stand.
This box was then filled with rich loam, and planted with
purple, white, and pink Maurandia, and variegated
Myrtle. These vines twined over the handle, and festooned
the sides of the box. Lobelias, Fuchsias, Nierembergias,
white and scarlet monthly Pinks, silver-leaved
Geranium, and King of the Scarlets, also one
white monthly Rose in the centre, filled the box with
bright flowers all summer. This inexpensive flower-stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
was constructed by a boy during his school vacation,
and it formed a beautiful centre ornament to his
mother’s front yard. In the winter the good mother had
her boy’s work carefully removed and placed in her bay
window. There it blossomed, and spoke cheering words
to her of her absent darling, as she sat day by day, during
the cold winter months, sewing by its side.</p>


<h3>14.—HANGING BASKETS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Hanging baskets</span> are now in such universal use, that
the taste for them has extended to every town or village
in our land. All florists keep a supply of baskets, with
flowers planted and growing, ready for sale. These baskets
are quite expensive. We will give directions for
some equally pretty, but inexpensive, which any ingenious
boy or girl can make.</p>

<p>Take a small wooden bowl, bore holes in the sides to
fasten in a cord, or screw in rings. Cover this with
cones, acorns, black beans, &amp;c., in fact, any pretty seed
can be used to good effect; arrange them in different
forms, like flowers. Varnish with asphaltum varnish.
A cocoanut shell makes a pretty small basket. Either
of the above are pretty with the white and green dry
moss glued over the outside. Baskets can be made of
sticks of the oak or maple tree, choosing those of
the size of a man’s thumb, and cutting them of equal
lengths, eight, ten, or twelve inches, according to the
size of the basket desired. Then build your basket like
a log hut; interlace your fingers, and you will see the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
design. Nail these sticks firmly in place, fasten in a
wooden bottom. Heat a wire and thrust it through the
end of each stick, and bend it into a loop; suspend it by
cords fastened to these loops. This makes a durable
basket to hang out of doors; any boy of twelve could
make it.</p>

<p>Rustic baskets can be made with or without a wooden
frame, but a wooden bowl is a good foundation; procure
from the woods a quantity of blasted branches, or other
crooked, rough, or knotty twigs. Soak them in hot water
or steam them, so as to make them pliable. Stain the
bowl with asphaltum or black varnish, then screw in
rings for the hanging cords to pass through. When the
varnish is dry, bend around the outside of the bowl one
of the twigs or blasted branches, and nail it securely at
the top edges on either side. Twine several pieces around
in this way, according to your taste, until the whole surface
is covered; finish by nailing one around the rim of
the basket for a border. Varnish the branches like the
bowl. The entire basket is then ready for use. All
kinds of shaped baskets can be made out of wire, painting
them green, and filling in moss in all the crevices; a
painted tin dish, placed in for the dirt, will surely prevent
any drip; thick moss is ordinarily sufficient. All kinds
of these baskets should be filled up with light, sandy
loam; a few bits of charcoal, and a piece of sponge in
the bottom, assist in keeping the soil moist. Light,
trailing vines should be trained to fall over the sides,
and loop in and out of rustic work. We will give a
short list of vines suitable for baskets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<dl>
<dd>Lobelia Erinus Paxtoni, an exquisite blue.</dd>
<dd>White and pink Gypsophila.</dd>

<dd>Variegated Myrtle.</dd>
<dd>Geranium Peltatum Elegans.</dd>
<dd>Nierembergia.</dd>
<dd>Linaria Cymbalaria.</dd>
<dd>All varieties of Maurandia Barclayana.</dd>

<dd>Bijou Zonale.</dd>
<dd>Achyronthes Gilsoni.</dd>
<dd>Mrs. Pollock, &amp;c.</dd>
</dl>

<p>These baskets should be exposed to the sun at least
two or three hours daily, and in dry weather watered
freely. If the surface of the basket between the plants
is covered with moss, it will prevent the earth from drying
as soon, and the basket will look neater.</p>

<p>Baskets of moss and wire can be every week dipped
into a pail of water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>


<h3>15.—ARTIFICIAL ROCKERIES.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">A well-formed</span> and flourishing rockery is an ornament
to every lawn.</p>

<p>Petrified wood forms very beautiful rockeries, but as
our purpose is to assist our young friends to make their
own rockeries, we will leave the more elaborate to the
gardener.</p>

<p>Save all the clinkers from your furnace coal, dip them
in a hot lime wash to color them pure white, their fantastic
shapes are thus more conspicuous; arrange them
in a mound according to your fancy; leave at suitable
distances cavities of six or eight inches deep, to be filled
with soil; in this plant your creeping plants; bright
colors should be selected for a white rockery. Dwarf
Scarlet Tropæolum, Scarlet Verbenas, Petunias, Golden
Moneywort, Lobelias, Scarlet Geraniums, Myrtles,
Coleus, German Ivy, &amp;c., are used to good effect on this
rock work. Hydraulic cement instead of lime will
make a pretty drab color. If the rockery is protected
by some shade, it looks well to plant it with Ferns and
Lycopodiums.</p>


<h3>16.—FERNERIES.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Is</span> it not, friends, very pleasant to have a bit of the
summer woods in our parlors in midwinter? Such a
pleasure is within the reach of us all, with but little
trouble and expense. Those who live in cities, and cannot
go into the country, surely must have some friend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
who can supply them, or the materials can be obtained at
any public green-house. First you require a glass dome,
or what is still better, take five panes of glass, any size
you please, four to form the sides, one for the top;
fasten the glass together with a light wooden frame, then
take any tin dish, like a baking pan, or if round, a tin
plate or jelly cake pan, or a tin dish can be made to fit
it for a trifling sum of money; paint the tin green on the
outside. Then collect some pieces of broken flower pots,
or still better, bits of marble, granite, or any stone, and
scatter them around the tin dish, placing in the centre
some moss-grown stump or stick, and pile the stones
around it; then collect from the woods ferns, mosses,
partridge vines, with its bright red berries (indeed any
plant will grow in these ferneries which can be found in
moist places in the woods); take up a little of the leaf
mould in which they grow (they need but little soil),
arrange your plants, spreading the roots carefully over
the stones, scattering a little leaf mould on them, and
place your mosses around the whole. The tallest plants
should form the centre, but in arranging even ferneries,
it is more agreeable to exercise your own taste. Before
placing your globe or glass frame over your fernery,
sprinkle the plants thoroughly, then cover with the glass,
and let it remain a few days in the shade. You can
keep them where you please, but they grow better near a
window; be very careful not to water them too often;
once a month is generally sufficient; if too wet, they
will mould and die; when there is but little moisture on
the glass, it is well to raise the glass to ascertain if it is
dry. Our fernery has been made four years; it has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
required but little care; now and then we add a new
fern, some moss, or any suitable plant gathered from the
woods, and remove any dried ferns or leaves. It often
renews itself. Trailing Arbutus and partridge vines will
blossom in ferneries. It is always pleasant to the eye,
and no care after the first expense and trouble. Ivy and
Lycopodium grow well in ferneries, but the rare ferns,
&amp;c., from green-houses do not flourish as well as those
plants taken from our native woods.</p>


<h3>17.—IVIES.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">English Ivies</span> are a great ornament to our rooms, and
are hardy, and require very little care. After the first
two years they grow quite rapidly, therefore it is well to
procure two-year old plants; train them on your curtains,
over your windows and pictures. Many make a
mistake by changing the pots very often, thinking they
require a very large pot, which is not so, for they do not
require as much earth as many plants, only keep them
moist, and have rich loam for the soil; it is well to water
them every month with guano water, prepared according
to the same rule given for flowers. The Poet’s Ivy
is very pretty, the leaf being quite small. The most
beautiful ivy we ever saw was one that never was removed
from its place, summer or winter; it filled a large
bay window, encircled the whole room, and wound
around many pictures; now and then a gardener came
and changed the soil, and the leaves were occasionally
washed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>


<h3>18.—PRESSED FLOWERS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> press flowers, to be arranged on paper like a
painting, you must take some plain white wrapping
paper (in Paris you can obtain paper prepared by a
chemical process to preserve the colors), and place your
flowers or leaves carefully between two sheets of the
paper. Then press them by placing a heavy weight over
them (letter presses are excellent), and leave them a day
or two, then change the paper; thus the juices of the
flowers are absorbed. It takes a week or two to press
perfectly, and in summer often longer. When dry, place
them in a book or some air-tight box, ready for use. A
year is required to make a varied and handsome collection,
as each flower has its own season for blossoming.
Wild flowers retain their colors better than cultivated;
but experience alone will teach you what flowers will retain
their color best. Many pretend to be able to preserve
all kinds of flowers, but it is impossible. I will
give a list of flowers which are known to retain their
color by this mode of pressing.</p>

<p>All Geraniums (except the horse-shoe and sweet-scented)
preserve their color. They are very essential,
as their colors are brilliant and keep for years. All
yellow flowers, both wild and cultivated, retain their
color. The Violet and Pansy, Dwarf Blue Convolvulus,
Blue Larkspur, Blue Myrtle, Blue Lobelia, Heaths, the
small original Red Fuchsia, Wild Housatonia, and many
tiny blue, and even white flowers press perfectly.</p>

<p>For green, Ivy, Maiden Hair, Ferns or Brake, Mosses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
&amp;c., retain their color best. Rarely a cultivated green
leaf presses well. Autumn leaves, if small, and the
youngest oak leaves, mix in well. Certain kinds of stems,
such as Pansy, and others of similar character, are best
adapted for pressing.</p>

<p>After your collection is made, take some card-board,
without a polish if possible, and arrange your flowers as
you design to have them. Gum them to the paper with
tragacanth, using a camel’s hair brush, then press on
the paper and flower with a cloth, carefully absorbing all
moisture, as well as firmly pressing the flower on the
paper. Geraniums and some large flowers look better
if each leaf is glued on separately.</p>

<p>In forming your bouquet, it is better to arrange the
stems first and work upwards. Baskets and vases of
moss with flowers are pretty. To form these you must
trace out with a pencil your vase or basket, and glue on
the moss. Then arrange your flowers.</p>

<p>We have heard amusing criticisms on the coloring of
such bouquets from persons who mistook them for
paintings. Framed and covered with a glass, they make
ornamental pictures.</p>

<p>It is a pleasant way of preserving mementos of
friends, places, or events. Flower albums or journals
are very beautiful. Wreaths arranged of different varieties
of Pelargoniums, mixed in with any pretty green,
and other little flowers, such as Lobelias, are very handsome,
and the colors are durable. Pansies of different
shades look well, and brilliant wreaths may be made of
all the varieties of flowers that hold their color. The
oval shape looks the best for wreaths.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>There are innumerable varieties of Ferns, Lycopodiums,
and Maiden Hair, both native and foreign, suitable
for pressing. By pasting each specimen on a separate
sheet, and interspersing specimens of our beautiful
autumn leaves, also on separate sheets, and fastening
them together, either bound as a book, or in a portfolio,
you will possess a beautiful and attractive book with but
little expense.</p>

<p>Crosses can be arranged with Ferns, and shaded to
appear as if painted in perspective, and look like a cross
standing on a mossy bank, with flowers, &amp;c., growing
around and over it. First draw and shade your cross,
as a guide, then take the small leaflets of the darkest
colored ferns you can procure, and glue them on carefully
where the cross should be in shadow darkest, then take
the brighter green Ferns (such as are gathered in
spring), and end with the white Ferns (which can only
be obtained in the fall), using them for the lightest
shade; be careful to cover every part, and shade it with
Nature’s colors as you would with paint. In a cross six
inches high, and suitably proportioned, full two hundred
of the tiny leaflets of the Fern may be used to good advantage
before it is completed. Then take wild Lycopodium,
if you can obtain it, if not, the finest of the cultivated,
and arrange it on your cross to look like a vine
growing over and hanging from it; also paste on to it
tiny little pressed Lobelias, and arrange small Ferns,
mosses, and any little flowers (wild ones are preferable)
around the base of the cross, to look like a mossy bank.
Different designs can be arranged in the same way.</p>

<p>Be very careful in pasting on flowers and leaves, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
every part, however small, is firmly fixed to the paper;
press them on after pasting with a dry cloth.</p>

<p>September is the time to collect the beautiful white
ferns; the first slight frost turns the green fern white.
They should then be gathered at once, and carefully
pressed; when dry they resemble the skeleton leaves. A
vase of these forms a beautiful winter ornament. If you
defer gathering them till the heavy frosts come, they turn
brown.</p>


<h3>19.—STRAWBERRIES.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">A few</span> hints as regards the cultivation of strawberries
may be useful to both boys and girls; for fine berries
can be raised even on a small plot of ground, if the
soil be rich. Plants for a new bed should be set out
early in the spring; the roots will then grow strong, and
the plants will be better able to bear the cold of winter.
Some gardeners prefer to plant their strawberry roots in
August, or even late in the autumn, and if the winter is
mild, or deep snows cover the ground, the vines will live
and bear fruit the next summer. Some prefer to raise
strawberries in hills, but the most prolific vines are those
planted in beds about three feet wide, with a path between,
filled with straw, to keep the fruit from the
ground; it is well to cut off most of the runners. Of
course the beds should be kept free from weeds. There
are many new varieties, but the old Hovey’s Seedling
is as reliable as any, and very prolific. The Russell is
easily propagated; vines planted in April will often yield<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
fine strawberries in June. The Wilson is a profitable
strawberry for the market because of its large yield, but
it is hardly equal in flavor to the Hovey.</p>

<p>The Hovey will soon run out if planted by itself; it
requires some other kind to be planted with it. The Pine
is usually the variety selected for that purpose. It is
useless to enumerate the several varieties, for nearly
every locality has its favorite strawberry. Some kinds
will scarcely bear a perfect berry in some locations,
while in a different locality the same plant will be loaded
with perfect fruit. Sometimes a healthy and vigorous-looking
bed of strawberry plants will produce but few
berries; then you must examine the blossoms, those
which bear fruit will have the berry formed in the flower,
while others will blossom freely, but do not bear
fruit; these are the male plants, and it is better to leave
but few of them in your strawberry beds. When you
plant the new roots, dig a hole with a trowel and fill it
with water, then spread out the roots and pack the earth
close around them; but when they are fully rooted, and
commence to grow, the earth should be kept loose around
them.</p>

<p>Strawberry plants should be replanted every third year;
it is best to change the location of the bed if possible, or
at least to renew the soil. Boys or girls who raise and
gather from their own little garden a dish of strawberries,
will find great pleasure in presenting it to their
friends as fruits of their own labor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>


<h3>20.—GRAPES.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> care of the grape vine is a pleasant occupation.
To gather the rich, ripe bunches of its delicious fruit
is a grand enjoyment. Almost every one can command
a spot of ground sufficient for the liberal support
of a grape vine. It may be planted in any unappropriated
corner about the house—a sunny spot is to be
preferred; but a vine may do well with but little direct
sunshine, if it is well sheltered and properly cared for.
It may be planted at the foot of a tree, the branches of
which are not near the ground, and it will find its way
high up the tree, and will yield large crops of fine fruit,
hidden among its own thick foliage and that of the tree,
provided the ground immediately about its roots can be
reached and kept warm by the sun’s rays.</p>

<p>As it grows, it will endeavor to adapt itself to the circumstances
that surround it, and will take the direction
your taste or convenience require it to follow. Its flexible
branches are obedient to the gentle hand of the careful
cultivator. You may train it upon stakes six or eight
feet high, or upon a low trellis where the fruit will be
within easy reach of your hand. You may have the
fruit within a few inches of the ground, or by removing
all the lower branches of the vine, you can cause the ripe
bunches to hang in graceful festoons around and over the
window of your chamber, high above the reach of accident
and pilferers. The grape vine will do as it is bid,
which is much more than can be said of some young people,
whose eyes sparkle at the sight of its fruit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>In preparing the ground in which to plant the vine,
reference must be had to the character of the soil. If
the soil is clayey and cold, or if the neighboring surface
is such as to turn an undue proportion of the rains upon
the place where you propose to plant your vine, care must
be taken to secure for the roots of the vine a sufficient
drainage. If the roots of the vine are surrounded by
wet and cold earth, the fruit will mature slowly, and will
be endangered by the early frosts. You will secure a
sufficient drainage by digging a hole three feet deep and
five or six feet in diameter, and throwing into it small
stones, fragments of bricks, or other like rubbish, to the
depth of about eighteen inches, and filling to the surface
with the soil. If the soil in which you propose to
plant your vine is light, no artificial drainage will be
necessary.</p>

<p>Dig over the ground, and mix with it some well-rotted
manure or bone dust to the depth of your spade. The
plan of trenching and deep manuring is of questionable
advantage. The roots of the vine prefer to run near the
surface, but they will seek the rich soil wherever it may
be; and if they are drawn away from the surface of the
ground and out of their natural direction to the colder
soil below, the effect upon the fruit may be unfavorable,
both as to quality and quantity.</p>

<p>In the ground thus prepared, set your young vine from
the nursery. First, drive down a stake to which you can
tie the young vine, then place the roots of the vine three
inches below the surface of the ground, carefully spreading
the roots so that they will be as nearly as possible in
the position in which they grew in the nursery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>The beautiful operations of nature will then commence.
The roots of the vine will at once begin to adapt themselves
to their new home, and their delicate fibres will
firmly clasp the particles of the well-prepared soil; the
warm days of the early spring will draw the sap up
through the whole length of the vine; the buds will
open and exhibit their delicate tints, new shoots and
broad green leaves will follow, and you can soon eat the
fruit of your own labor, sitting beneath the shadow of
your own vine.</p>


<h3>21.—HOW TO ARRANGE SEA-MOSSES.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">While</span> our young friends are enjoying the pleasures
of the sea-shore, there is no more delightful employment
than gathering and preserving the beautiful flowers of
the sea.</p>

<p>September is the time to collect the finest varieties of
sea-mosses. Before you commence to arrange them,
procure two pieces of deal board, about twenty inches
long and twelve inches wide; some light-brown paper,
and blotting paper, and white drawing paper. You will
need camel’s-hair pencils, long, slender darning-needles
(or common needles mounted on lucifer matches), a small
piece of alum, and old cotton or linen cloth.</p>

<p>The best time for collecting the mosses is in the early
morning, when, on your return, there is leisure for immediately
laying them out. If you leave them until the
next day, the chances are that one half of them will be
spoiled. Do not collect many mosses at one time; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
these flowers of the sea fade, and even decompose very
fast, when roughly handled or carelessly gathered. If
you cannot arrange them at once, put them either in an
oil-skin bag, or a tin can, with sea-water. When you
are ready to arrange them, take your drawing paper and
cut it into large and small squares, or any size you desire.
Get some soup plates, or any shallow dish; fill
with fresh water; place a small piece of alum in each
dish. Now have your camel’s-hair pencils and darning-needles,
or needles mounted on matches, by your side.
Then float a piece of sea-moss in fresh water. If very
dirty or sandy, wash it first in clear water. Float it on
a piece of paper, which must be placed under it with the
left hand, while with your right hand you arrange the plant
in a natural manner, using your camel’s-hair pencils and
needles. Superabundant branches can be thinned out
with small, sharp-pointed scissors. When the specimen
is placed as you like it, cautiously raise the paper, that
the position of the plant be not altered, and let it rest
somewhere with sloping inclination, that the moisture
may run off, while other specimens are treated in the
same way. Do not leave them long thus, for they must
be pressed before the paper is dry. In drying them, you
must lay either old soft linen, or cotton over them, to
prevent its sticking to the upper paper when pressing;
as, in order to press it, you must first lay them in blotting
paper, and then in brown, and place them, thus
prepared, between your boards, and strap the two boards
tightly together. The blotting paper and old cloth must
be changed at least twice in drying large sea-weed. The
second day place a heavy pressure on the boards used in
pressing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>Sea-mosses are glutinous, and must be dried, and not
pressed; and, when finished and dry, then moisten the
under side of the paper, and press it gently. Others
will not adhere to paper, and therefore, when dry, should
be brushed over with a little isinglass, dissolved in gin,
laid on warm; and they will then be fixed closely to the
drawing paper.</p>

<p>Another preparation is one ounce of oil of turpentine,
in which some gum mastic, the size of a nutmeg, has
been dissolved. This gives a gloss to the specimen, and
helps to preserve the color.</p>

<p>The finest and rarest specimens are found in the lowest
tide pool, or cast up after a storm.</p>

<p>We have seen these sea-mosses, or sea-weeds, exquisitely
arranged, representing flower painting.</p>

<p>Take the pink and green sea-weed, and with practice,
moss-rose buds can be perfectly represented, also other
flowers. Be careful and select fine-grained, at the same
time <em>strong</em> paper.</p>

<p>Every lover of nature should always possess a microscope.
Examine with it many tiny specimens, condemned
as too small to arrange in your album; it will
reveal to you such form and color, provision and harmony,
as the Almighty Creator conceals from the unseeing
eye, and reveals to patient and intelligent search.</p>

<h3>1.—KNITTING.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Plain</span> knitting is but little noticed since knitting machines
were invented. At present crochet work has taken
its place, and fancy tatting. It will not be necessary for
us to give any especial directions for these kinds of work,
as nearly all our magazines give new directions in every
number. But both crochet and tatting require eyesight.
If a child is taught in early youth to knit well, all common
knitting can be done without eyesight. We can
<em>think</em> better if our hands are employed on plain knitting.
If our eyes have been overtasked, and cannot bear the
light, we can knit in the dark. We always keep some
common knitting, such as strips for a blanket, or stockings
for the poor, on hand; and it is astonishing the
amount of work accomplished in this way, as we can
knit, if a neighbor calls, for it does not prevent our conversing
freely, also we can knit and read.</p>

<p>We earnestly advise our young readers to learn to
knit. Many persons in the present era are afflicted with
weak eyes, and dislike to be idle; the knowledge of knitting
would be a pleasure, also of netting, as that requires
less eyesight than other branches of work. We will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
give the directions for knitting a few fancy articles, also
the directions for knitting a common stocking, so that
our young girls can knit substantial stockings for the
poor. During the last war, when our young ladies were
called upon to knit stockings, how few knew how! So
many, who earnestly desiring to do their part, were
obliged to learn the rudiments of knitting!</p>


<h3>2.—HOW TO KNIT A STOCKING.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">First</span> select four smooth steel needles of a size suitable
for the woollen or cotton yarn you intend to use.
If you cannot tell yourself, the person of whom you
purchase your yarn can select suitable needles. Your
stitches should be cast on with double yarn. Knitting
them on is preferable; first form a loop on one needle,
then by knitting that loop with another needle, the required
stitches can be formed. Some persons prefer a
little elastic roll at the top; this is formed by knitting
eight or ten rows round plain, then turn directly back
and knit on the wrong side a few times.</p>

<p>But the most common mode is purl every two stitches.
This is done by knitting two stitches and purling two.
It is well to continue this for a gentleman’s stocking or
a boy’s all the way to the heel, as they cling better to
the leg, or purl two and knit two for a half a finger,
then knit a finger and a half plain, and end the leg part
by purling two and two again at the ankle for an inch.
If the stocking is for a lady, after knitting four or five
inches from the top (the first inch being purled every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
two stitches), the narrowing should be commenced. In
plain knitting, one needle is called the seam needle, for
the centre stitch should be purled, and one must be taken
to purl that same stitch the whole length of the leg.
The narrowing of the leg should be done on each side of
the seam stitch. Then knit five or six rows before narrowing
again. The leg should be narrowed thus seven
or eight times to form a good shaped leg.</p>

<p>No rules for length, or the number of stitches to
be cast on a needle, can be given, as nearly every person
differs in size. The only sure way is to measure by
some old stocking. The heel must contain just half the
stitches in the whole stocking. Take off the stitches, for
the heel, on to one needle. A long heel makes a better
shaped stocking than a short one. When nearly done,
narrow five or six times on each side of the purl; for, in
taking off the stitches for the heel, the purl stitch must
be in the centre of the heel needle. The heel is knit
backwards and forwards like a garter, only it is purled
all across on the wrong side. The narrowing must all be
done on the plain knitting side. Some persons knit the
heel with double yarn; others, on the purling side, slip
a stitch and knit a stitch all across, and the next time
the purling side is knit, slip the stitch you <em>knit</em> before.
This makes a strong heel, almost equal to running a heel
after it is knit. To bind off the heel, you must place
half the stitches on one needle and half on another, then
place them side by side, and knit two stitches together
with a third needle, slip the first stitch knit with the third
needle over the second stitch all across, never leaving
but one stitch on the needle. Some finish the heel differently;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
they take just half the stitches of the heel in the
middle of the needle, leaving a quarter on one side and a
quarter on the other, and only knit the middle, but each
time take up one stitch from the side, and narrow it with
one on the middle, until all the stitches on the side are
gone.</p>

<p>The foot is formed by taking up the loops on each side
of the heel (these loops are formed in knitting the heel,
by always slipping the first stitch, as in a garter). In
knitting round the first time, it is necessary to widen on
the heel every third stitch, by taking up an additional
loop. It should then be narrowed on the corner of the
side needles, by narrowing two together of the four last
stitches on the first needle, then on the other side needle
knit two plain, slip a stitch and knit a stitch, and put the
slipped stitch over the knitted stitch, until the foot is
small enough. After the first few times around, it shapes
the instep better to narrow, then knit around without
slipping and binding. The next time knit past the narrowing
side plain, and slip and bind, therefore the size is
only lessened one stitch every row, forming a long gore.
The toe is formed by narrowing at the beginning and
end of each needle; first knit two plain and narrow, then
leave four at the end of the needle, narrow the first two,
and knit the other two plain; before narrowing, see that
the stitches on each needle number the same. Knit
around three times plain, then narrow as directed. Knit
three plain rounds between the narrowing three times.
Then knit twice around plain, three times between the
narrowing; then once, then narrow every time till there
are only four stitches; break off your yarn, leaving sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
to draw through the four stitches, and with a darning
needle fasten it strong.</p>

<p>Another way to narrow a toe off, is to narrow every
seven stitches when you begin the toe; knit seven times
around, and narrow every six stitches; knit six rows and
narrow every five stitches; knit five rows and narrow
every four stitches, so on to the end.</p>


<h3>3.—BABY’S KNITTED JACKET.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cast</span> on two hundred stitches on good sized steel
needles, knit quarter stitch eleven purls, that is twenty-two
times across; then, with colored split worsted, knit
three purls, then narrow every time, putting the worsted
twice over the needle each time to make holes; knit
three purls, then commence with the white worsted; knit
fourteen purls; divide the stitches into three parts, fifty
on each side, one hundred in the middle. Commence
with the middle, knit twenty-two purls, then narrow
each side of the needle every other time, making twenty-two
purls, bind off. Knit the fronts the same way,
narrowing only on one side.</p>

<h4>SLEEVES.</h4>

<p>Cast on sixty-five stitches, knit thirty-six purls, narrowing
each side of the needle every eighth purl; knit
three purls with color, make holes, then three more
purls, bind off fifty-four stitches, then sew up the shoulders,
take up the stitches round the neck, knit the same
with the colored worsted, as the border on the sleeves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
take up stitches down each side of the front, knit the
same border, only have one purl before making the holes,
then knit two purls.</p>

<h4>BORDER.</h4>

<p>Cast on eighteen stitches, and knit the same as border
for blanket, making seven holes instead of four. <em>Split
worsted is preferable.</em></p>


<h3>4.—BABY’S BLANKET.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Commence</span> with thirty stitches on a needle, and knit
Brioche stitch. Knit till you can count twenty-four
loops, then change the color (the stitch to be knit, is
slip a stitch, put thread in front and narrow, all across,
on both sides the same). You must always join the
color on the same side, and have a colored square in
each corner of your blanket. Knit seven squares in each
strip, and seven strips form the inside of the blanket.</p>


<h3>5.—BORDER TO BLANKET.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cast</span> on ten stitches, knit two plain, put your worsted
in front and narrow all the rest, but knit the last stitch
plain; that is, put your thread in front and narrow two
together, till there are two left; then put your thread in
front and knit one stitch; then the last one plain; knit
back plain; then knit three stitches, and the same as before,
only add a stitch every other time across, till you
have nineteen stitches; then knit twice plain, and knit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
eight, and narrow; then put your thread in front and
narrow four times; knit last stitch plain always, knit
back always plain; decrease one every other time till you
have ten, then knit a plain row to join your other color.
All the scallops are knit the same, and it needs thirty-two
blocks of edging to go round the blanket. The
colored point of each corner must be gathered up to the
point close, thus making the white come on each side of
the colored square.</p>

<p>It takes eight ounces of common zephyr worsted, four
ounces of each color.</p>

<p>This enlarged, makes very handsome carriage blankets,
with a palm leaf worked in each square; but instead of
a knitted border, it is better to tie in a heavy fringe of
worsted.</p>


<h3>6.—KNITTED BED-QUILTS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> requires a whole box of the red and white Saxony
yarn.</p>

<p>This should be knit with the finest ivory needles.
Cast on forty stitches. Knit the stripes garter stitch;
that is, knit backwards and forwards plain knitting, slipping
always the first stitch on the needle. Knitting it
thus, it makes every other time across look like purling.
The stripes must be four hundred purls in length; it
needs eleven stripes, red and white alternately. These
stripes must be sewed together, and the ends finished off
with a fringe, or knit a border. The directions given for
the border to the first baby’s blanket, knit it broader by
knitting six or seven stitches plain before you widen or
narrow to make holes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>A “couvre-pied” can be knit in the same manner,
only knit the stripes three hundred and ten purls in
length.</p>


<h3>7.—BABY’S BLANKET.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">A beautiful</span> blanket can be knit with stripes, alternating
pink and white. Knit plain garter stitch, each
stripe a yard long; the white stripes should be the narrowest,
eighteen stitches for the white and twenty-two
for the pink. When finished, then work in the white
stripes, a pink rose-bud and a green leaf, as small as
possible, then sew all together, making the blanket a
square yard.</p>

<h4>BORDER.</h4>

<p>Cast on sixteen stitches.</p>

<p><i>First row.</i> Knit three, turn over twice, purl two together,
knit two, turn over twice, knit two together, turn
over twice, knit two together, knit five.</p>

<p><i>Second row.</i> Knit seven, purl one, knit two, purl
one, knit two, turn over twice, purl two together, knit
three.</p>

<p><i>Third row.</i> Knit three, turn over twice, purl two together,
knit thirteen.</p>

<p><i>Fourth row.</i> Knit thirteen, turn over twice, purl two
together, knit three.</p>

<p><i>Fifth row.</i> Knit three, turn over twice, purl two together,
knit two, turn over twice, knit two together, turn
over twice, knit two together, turn over twice, knit two
together, knit five.</p>

<p><i>Sixth row.</i> Knit seven, purl one, knit two, purl one,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
knit three, purl one, knit two, turn over twice, purl two
together, knit three.</p>

<p><i>Seventh row.</i> Knit three, turn over twice, purl two
together, knit six, turn.</p>

<p><i>Eighth row.</i> Cast off five, knit ten, turn over twice,
purl two together, knit three.</p>


<h3>8.—SOFA CUSHION.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cast</span> by knitting sixteen stitches, knit plain four rows
like a garter, knit eight stitches, turn and purl four, knitting
heel stitch (that is, plain in front, and purl on the
back side), ten times on the four stitches. Then slip the
four stitches from the needle while you take up the next
four, then return them again and knit the remaining four,
turn and knit twelve stitches, then take up the last loop
on the roll, and narrow it off with the first stitch of the
last four, then knit the last three plain. Then knit four
rows plain (which makes three rows of purling on the
right side between each roll). Now commence another
roll, same as before. It takes seven ounces of tapestry
worsted, or double zephyr, one ounce to a stripe. Be
careful and select colors that will harmonize together.</p>


<h3>9.—TABLE MATS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Table</span> mats, made of coarse white tidy yarn—with
the plain crochet stitch and a scallop border—are easily
worked, and do not strain the eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>


<h3>10.—CARRIAGE OR BED-ROOM MAT.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">A very</span> pretty carriage or bed-room mat may be made
in knitting. Collect as much flannel list, or flannel and
woollen cloth as you can; cut it into short lengths, and
knit a few rows, for a foundation, in twine. Then take
a piece of list, put it across the string, and knit it in
tightly; knit the pieces of list in this way all across;
then knit a row plain; then knit in a row with the list.
If you knit an edge of scarlet flannel, say six rows first,
and six stitches at the beginning and end of each row, of
pieces of the scarlet, and six rows of scarlet at the ending,
your mat will be improved, particularly if the centre
is knit entirely of gray list, as the gray and scarlet are
very effective. When completed, line it with a nice
coarse brown cloth. Pretty mats can be knit entirely of
old pieces of cloth of any kind, by cutting it in narrow
strips and sewing each strip together; knit it with large
needles either in strips or squares, and sew them firmly
together; take your pieces at odd times and strip them
up, and as you sew them together, roll them into balls
ready for knitting, then arrange your colors to harmonize
together.</p>


<h3>11.—KNITTED MOSS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cast</span> on about fifty stitches of light green Berlin wool;
slip a stitch on your needle without knitting, and knit
the next row. Continue the same until you have finished
two skeins of wool, taking care never to knit the first
stitch of each line. Then knit on it, in the same manner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
two skeins of the next shade darker of color, and continue
in the same manner until you have knitted up five shades
of green; join on a rich brown, and a faded moss-colored
wool, and then cast off. Wet your knitting through with
clear water, then dry it over a furnace register, or cover
it with a paper or cloth, and press it with a hot iron.
Let it remain for a few hours untouched, then unfasten
the last stitch, and pull it out. It will unravel easily,
from the first stitch of each row not having been knitted,
and you will have a good curling imitation of moss to
sew on to baskets or for borders of mats.</p>


<h3>12.—PLAIN NEEDLE-WORK, AND USEFUL
HINTS FOR YOUNG LADIES.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> young ladies formerly were educated thoroughly
in needle-work. Plain sewing was taught in the primary
schools; but, alas! these times seem past; it is rare to
find a little girl of even ten years old who can hem a
pocket-handkerchief well. The children of our mechanics
grow up with but little knowledge of useful work.
Their mothers, with mistaken love, mend, dress, and
make their wearing apparel. Often they marry wholly
ignorant of the accomplishments <em>necessary</em> for a true
wife and helpmeet—that is, the knowledge of housekeeping,
plain sewing, and cutting out the simplest garment.</p>

<p>Who is to blame for this? The excuse of many a
hard-working mother is, “I have not had time to teach
my daughters;” and of our ladies of wealth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span> “I did not
suppose my daughters would ever be poor, or require
such knowledge!”</p>

<p>It is a very great pity sewing is not taught in our
common schools. It is quite as important to our girls
as reading, writing, spelling, &amp;c. There is no country
in the world where a <em>practical</em> education is so necessary
as in ours, the fluctuations of fortune are so great. The
rich man of to-day may be the poor man of to-morrow.
Therefore every boy and girl in the land should have a
useful and practical education. Our girls especially, rich
or poor, need a knowledge of practical housekeeping; it
is not possible for any lady to be a good housekeeper unless
she knows how things should be done herself, as a
trained servant in our free country is rarely found.</p>

<p>Plain sewing is also very important to be learned in
early youth. In these days of machinery much of the
old plain work is done by the swift needle of the sewing
machine, rather than by hand; and it is expected, by
and by, that hemming, stitching, over-hand work, and
gathering will be as much forgotten as the old tambour
stitch and embroidery of our ancestors. But we maintain
that a person to work well on a machine should
first be taught to sew well, and it is quite possible work
may be required when no machine is to be hired. If
young ladies are always able to hire their sewing, it may
be pleasant to work for the poor. We hope our young
readers may be induced, of their <em>own</em> desire, to become
<em>good sempstresses</em>. If any one reading this book is induced
to obtain <em>practical</em> knowledge on the subject, we
shall feel repaid, and we would gladly hear from them.
We will now give a few directions as an assistance, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the same time begging our young readers to remember
that one lesson from a good sempstress is worth a dozen
pages of print.</p>

<p>A hem should be, generally, narrow and very even;
if it is to be wide, cut a measure the desired width, and
be careful to have it exact; the stitches should be taken
through, but so small as to be nearly invisible. A hem
on clear muslin will look neater if it is finely <em>run</em> like
the seam of a dress.</p>

<p>In over-hand sewing the stitches should be taken on the
edge of the two sides, and should lay quite close to each
other, so as to look like purling.</p>

<p>In stitching you should only take up two threads, both
behind and before the needle.</p>

<p>Gathering is done on the needle, two threads taken up
and four left, and the line should be kept very straight by
a thread, if possible. The gathers, when finished, are
drawn very tightly together on the thread, and stroked
down smoothly with a strong needle or pin.</p>

<p>Darning is done by taking every other thread (in a
stocking), and leaving a long loop at the end of each line.
The darn is crossed by taking every other thread alternately,
each way. It used to be called “weaving.” If
muslin is to be darned, it is better to use ravellings of
the same instead of thread.</p>

<p>Should you have a rent in a dress to repair, use ravellings
of the same material; they are easily to be obtained
from the turning in of the top of the skirt, if you have no
pieces; but generally some are left by the dressmaker,
and should be kept for such accidents. In mending by
piecing, be careful that you do it very neatly; match<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
stripes or patterns on the material artfully, and you will
have the triumph of preventing the defacement of your
dress.</p>

<p>Learn how to make and trim a bonnet, or make a
graceful bow of ribbon. Young ladies of small means,
who are ingenious and tasteful, often present a better
appearance by making things for themselves, than those
who, without taste or neatness, spend large sums at the
milliners’. We advise you to try and make your own
dresses.</p>

<p>In order to do this, rip up an old dress that fits you;
lay the several portions of the body on a large sheet of
brown paper, with the turnings <em>turned in</em>; trace the pattern
carefully with a black pencil; then draw a line
round the whole, including the turnings-in, and cut it
out. Pin this pattern on your material, and cut out the
dress, taking care that you do not get two fronts for the
same side, if there is a right and wrong surface to it.
To prevent the possibility of this mistake, it is well to
fold the material and cut both at once. The same may
be said with regard to the side bodies. Greater skill is
required to put the skirt into a band, than in making a
body, in order that it may hang gracefully; but as
fashions change continually, we can only advise you to
get a good pattern to copy from, and <em>care</em> and <em>patience</em>
will insure you success. If your means render it unnecessary
or not expedient for you to make your own dresses,
you will find it pleasant to be able to make up the cotton
dress you destine for some poor neighbor, whose want of
time for needle-work will render her as much obliged for
the <em>labor</em> bestowed, as for the material itself. Making
clothes for poor children is <em>active charity</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>We know of a young lady so naturally industrious,
that at the age of six years, she made entirely every part
of a day shirt for her father. It is not as likely, at the
present day, that your labors will be required for shirt-making
for your male relatives; they generally prefer
buying their linen ready made. Every <em>woman</em> ought to
know how to put one together.</p>

<p>Any child or young lady who can make a shirt well,
can easily manufacture all female undergarments; patterns
for cutting out will be all that will be required. Both
cotton and linen cloth should be scalded in <em>soap-suds</em>, dried
and pressed <em>without</em> rinsing, before you work on them, in
order to render them soft enough for the needle to pass
through easily. But should you be unable to have this
done, rub the parts you are going to sew or hem with a
cake of white soap, or make a strong suds and brush the
parts. Your needle will move easily, and will run no
risk of breaking.</p>

<p>We advise young ladies who have the care of their
own linen, and perhaps have their own allowance for
dress, to take a few hours on one fixed day, weekly, to
look over their clothes, and make any small repairs that
may be wanted. They will find the truth of the old
adage,—“A stitch in time saves nine,”—and will make
their linen last as long again as it would otherwise do.
Gloves should be neatly mended, and no rip suffered to
remain a day. White and light-colored gloves can be
nicely cleaned by rubbing them with a flannel dipped in
milk and white hard soap. When dry they will need to
be pulled till they are soft and in shape.</p>

<p>Cultivate, we beseech of you, habits of neatness in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
early youth. Dresses should never be put away dirty,
or with spots that can be removed, or thrown down in a
heap. Benzine or chloroform will remove nearly all
kinds of spots, but it must be quickly rubbed dry, or it
will leave a spot. Wax spots from candles can be removed
from any material by placing over the spot some
brown or blotting paper, and place over it an iron sufficiently
hot to melt the grease; change the paper until
all the grease is thus absorbed.</p>

<p>Our young readers may be assured that the little care
bestowed on keeping their garments neat, clean, and
whole, will give to their appearance that air of freshness
which in itself is a charm, and will prove the truest
economy. Moreover, the power of using the needle
skilfully will give good manipulation for other and more
artistic employments, and can never be aught but a blessing
to the American girl.</p>


<h3>13.—EMBROIDERY IN SPANGLES AND CANNETILLE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Bullion</span>, which is a large gold wire, of which officers’
epaulets are made, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">frisure</i>, a smaller bullion, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">clanquant</i>,
which is a flat gold ribbon, are all classed under
the denomination of cannetille. Leaf-shaped spangles
are called laine.</p>

<p>Stretch the velvet, cloth, or silk which you intend to
embroider in a frame, and tack over it your pattern,
which must be nicely drawn on silver paper. Suppose
your pattern is a wreath of grape-vine leaves and grapes;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
you must put bullion on for the centre stem. This is done
by running a needle and thread through the tube, and fastening
it with an occasional (strongly sewn) stitch or two.
Take the smaller bullion, or frisure, for the outlines of the
leaves and tendrils, fastening it on in the same manner
as the large bullion; vein the leaves with fine gold thread.</p>

<p>Make your grapes of large spangles, and purple or
green glass beads, thus: Pass your needle through the
velvet from underneath, take a spangle on it, then take a
purple bead; pass your needle again through the spangle
and back through the velvet. Then begin another grape
in the same way, and fasten carefully off when your silk
is used up. A wreath of grapes and holly (the holly
berries red beads) round the edge of a table cover would
look very nice. The cover should be of dark cloth, and
edged with gold cord all around.</p>


<h3>14.—EMBROIDERY IN LAMÉ OF VELVET
AND GOLD.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Fix</span> your material in a frame. Tack over it your
pattern drawn on silver paper, or sketch it lightly on the
surface of the cloth or silk.</p>

<p>Work your stems and tendrils in frisure, your berries
or little flowers in spangles.</p>

<p>You can purchase stamped velvet leaves, which you
must fasten with strong gum to your velvet or silk, and
then keep them firm by veining them with gold thread.</p>

<p>Petals of flowers may be cut out of colored velvet,
and arranged on the cloth or velvet, if the young needlewoman
has sufficient taste to form a flower.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>The work may be done entirely of cachemire and
gold on cloth, if a more expensive material is beyond
the worker’s means.</p>


<h3>15.—EMBROIDERY IN FEATHERS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Stretch</span> your material for the ground on a frame.
Cover the back or under side of your feathers with thin
gum, to keep the tiny plumage together, and let them
dry. Take a sharp pair of scissors, and cut the feathers
into the shape of the petals you require; lay them separately
on your pattern, and tack them firmly on the silk
or cloth with sewing silk of the same color. Work
stems, tendrils, and centres with silk of the color required.
Of course you must arrange your petals or
leaves according to your pattern.</p>

<p>Any white feathers dyed are suitable for this work.</p>


<h3>16.—CORK WORK.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Very</span> beautiful articles can be made by ingenious boys
and girls, from cork bark. Those of our readers who
have only seen cork work in the shape of common bottle
corks, will not be attracted by the title of this chapter.
But all who have seen, either at home or abroad, the
exquisite models of castles, old ruins, churches, and
many other picturesque objects, made entirely from this
material, will welcome a few simple directions for this
work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>We will first speak of the cork bark, as it may not be
generally known that cork is not indigenous, but is the
soft, elastic bark of a species of oak tree, that grows
abundantly in the northern part of France, Spain, and
Italy. When the tree is fifteen years old the barking is
commenced, and is repeated at intervals of eight years,
the bark improving with every operation. The cork is
stripped from the tree in July and August; it is then
piled up in water under heavy stones, to flatten it, after
which it is fire dried, and packed in bales for exportation.
The cork cutters divide the sheets of cork in narrow strips,
and after cutting them the proper length, round them with
a thin, sharp-bladed knife into a cylindrical form. The
cork tree and uses of its bark were known to the
Greeks and Romans.</p>

<p>Cork bark can be obtained at any of the numerous
cork factories; it is not expensive, and the refuse bark
can be used in making many pretty models.</p>

<p>The beginner should select the simplest subjects for
his first work, such as a rustic cottage, bridge, or simple
ruins.</p>

<p>When a certain amount of proficiency has been attained,
it will be easy to advance to higher themes, until
the most elaborate designs may be attempted without
fear of failure.</p>

<p>In this art, models or pictures, with some description
of the proportions, are sufficient guides.</p>

<p>In this work no tools are required except a sharp penknife
and a glue-pot.</p>

<p>The walls of buildings must be cut from the cork
block. The proper thickness for the cork used in making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
walls is about one half, or even one quarter of an
inch, and the smoothest cork should always be selected
for this work.</p>

<p>When the required size has been obtained, square it
smoothly to the shape called for, making the two side walls
exactly alike. Next mark with a black lead pencil the
shapes of the windows, doors, &amp;c. Then cut the windows
with a penknife, making the opening smaller on
the inner side, but slanting outwardly, especially in the
sill the slope is very considerable, and in gothic windows
should never be flat or square. The waste and refuse
pieces of common cork will all be of use in making the
trimmings and ornamental work. For the mouldings
around the windows, cut small rims of cork, like your
model, and glue them on at proper distances from the
outer edges. Thin sheets of mica glued on the inside
of the windows, are excellent substitutes for glass; the
appearance of stained glass can be given by gumming
paper of the color you desire to represent, on the inside,
over the mica. All ornaments can be formed of tiny
shavings of cork. The gables, doors, &amp;c., are prepared
as the model may require. The most suitable base, on
which to glue your building, is a board covered with
green cloth or baize. The four walls can now be glued
together and placed on the green cloth board. If not
firm, small splints of wood, shaved so as to fit into the inner
corners, will strengthen the edifice. The roof comes
next, and can be made of smooth seasoned wood, about
a sixteenth of an inch thick.</p>

<p>Cut the board large enough to extend well over the
edges, so as to form eaves; glue one side firmly along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
the gable ends, then fit the peak of the other side. A
roof with a high pitch adds much to the tasteful appearance
of a rustic church. If there is to be a steeple, or
spire, the tower, or base of the building should be formed
of small pieces, cut so as to fit the slopes of the roof,
and built as a mason joins bricks or square blocks in a
wall. When the base is formed square and flat on top,
the tapering spire should start from this foundation, with
a round, or eight-sided piece of cork, whose four opposite
sides are exactly the size of the square base on
which it is to be glued; on this place another cork a
trifle smaller; this in turn will be covered with another
still less; so on until it tapers to a point.</p>

<p>Common bottle corks, of various sizes, are best to use
for spires and columns.</p>

<p>The best way to make spires or columns, is to glue
them in proper shape separately from the building; when
all are joined, shave them carefully, so as to form the
proper slope for the spire, and the columns can be cut
with a knife to imitate fluted sides, or in any desirable
way. When they are finished, glue them in the proper
place on your buildings.</p>

<p>The outside ornaments, such as a cross or vane for
the point of the spire, the caps of the columns, the buttresses,
eaves, moulding around the doors, porches over the
entrance, cornices, &amp;c., may now be added. The roof
may be colored with a little vandyke brown or burned
umber, mixed either in turpentine or oil; a single coat
will be sufficient, and if a rough appearance is desired,
dust some fine sand over it before the paint is dry.</p>

<p>If you glue moss on to the base board, it adds to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
natural appearance of the building. If you design to
represent a ruin, or Gothic church, a little green moss,
neatly gummed on to represent ivy and other creeping
vines, is an improvement. Time adds grace to all
ruins, by its moss and vines, planted by divine Providence.</p>

<p>Landscapes, in the picture style, are often designed with
cork; the finest shavings of cork can be used to cut
into shapes to represent a castle, a light-house with rocks
near by, a bridge, or whatever else may be selected to
form the design. Some idea of perspective drawing will
be necessary in this work; the object should be arranged
and fastened with gum arabic on to a piece of white
card-board, and the sky slightly tinted in water-colors
for a back ground. Irregular edges increase the resemblance
to distant hills, and sharp edges of thicker cork
represent the objects in the foreground.</p>

<p>There is no attempt to imitate nature in the variety of
color, for the picture wears the sombre shade of cork,
but the general effect is pleasing; the light background,
seen through the thin shavings of cork, give a good idea
of brown autumnal forests.</p>

<p>Crosses to train ivy on can be made of cork.</p>

<p>We trust our readers will be induced to try this cork
work. It is often difficult to know what to make for
fairs or for Christmas presents. This work in our
country is rarely seen, and it would sell well, or prove a
pretty present, if neatly done; but, like all things worth
doing, it requires time, practice, and patience to insure
perfect success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>


<h3>17.—BLACK LANDSCAPE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Pass</span> a card, or a piece of card-board, through the
smoke of a candle till it is quite black.</p>

<p>Then take a penknife and scratch upon it any landscape
or design you please.</p>

<p>Moonlight scenery is very effective in this way. In
case of lack of pencils, &amp;c., this is not a bad way of
sketching a scene one desires to remember.</p>


<h3>18.—VEGETABLE FLOWERS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Boys</span> and girls who live in the country will find it a
pleasant winter evening pastime to make a bouquet of
vegetable flowers.</p>

<p>First gather from the woods laurel leaves and other
evergreens. Then by the exercise of taste, ingenuity,
and a skilful use of the penknife, really beautiful bouquets
can be compiled of these flowers, with the addition
of sprigs of evergreen. White turnips, yellow turnips,
beets, carrots, pumpkins, and portions of cabbages, can
be used for the flowers.</p>

<p>Take a white turnip, neatly peeled, notched exactly
down in leaf shape all round. Then fasten to a stem
whittled from wood. Surround it with green leaves, and
behold either an exquisite white camellia or a rose!
Moss rose buds can be made by cutting turnips or beets
into the proper shape, and placing real moss around
them. Red roses, camellias, or dahlias can be made in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
the same way from beets. Yellow flowers from carrots
and pumpkins. White or red flowers from white and
red cabbages.</p>

<p>Beautify your houses, however poor or humble your
lot; a bare, comfortless room does not excite home love.</p>


<h3>19.—ORNAMENTAL SEED WORK.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have seen exhibited at agricultural fairs some
really beautiful frames and boxes ornamented with common
garden seeds.</p>

<p>If our boys and girls will begin early in the summer,
and collect every variety of seed possible, such as all
kinds of beans, corn, melons, &amp;c., they will have abundant
material for this kind of ornamental work in the
winter.</p>

<p>Every seed of size sufficient for handling should be
saved; even small polished black or yellow seeds, like
poppy seed, can be preserved to scatter over the ground-work.
Dry all the seeds carefully, and place them in
boxes ready for use. This work can be applied with
excellent effect in ornamenting boxes, picture frames,
hanging baskets, book racks, flower stands, small tables,
brackets, &amp;c. Get the frame of wood, of any article you
intend to ornament with seed work; stain the wood with
walnut staining materials, or varnish with asphaltum
varnish. It is not desirable to have a high polish on the
surface intended to be ornamented, as the glue will not
adhere to a very smooth substance. Keep your woodwork
in some dry place, until you are ready to glue on
the seeds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>When you have a leisure day or evening, place your
frame of wood before you, and the boxes of seeds around
it. When your glue is hot, spread a little over a small
space with a brush, and arrange your seeds in the form
of some flower or other figure.</p>

<p>It is difficult to give explicit rules for the work. It is
best for each person to exercise his or her taste and
ingenuity in arranging the designs. As the work proceeds,
an endless variety of shapes and styles of designs
will suggest themselves.</p>

<p>An accurate resemblance to nature is not easily attainable
in this kind of work.</p>

<p>When all the ornamental work is arranged, the small
spaces left uncovered should be brushed over with a thin
coat of varnish, and sprinkled with any small seeds.
Black seeds are very desirable, as they form a good
ground-work, and afford a proper relief to the designs.
When the glue has become hard, apply to the whole
work an even coat of copal varnish. If this is not sufficient,
apply another coat; it is needed, as some seeds
absorb more than others.</p>


<h3>20.—HOW TO IMPRESS LEAVES ON
VELVET.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> work is very easy and very pretty, requiring
only great nicety and care, and some taste. Take a
piece of white cotton velvet (such as undertakers use as
a lining to burial caskets), white jean, or white linen,
or fine, thin muslin; cut it out in the form of a tidy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
mat, or whatever you wish to make. Then pin upon it
carefully, with very minute pins, Ferns, Maiden’s Hair,
or any graceful leaf, in the form of a wreath or
bouquet.</p>

<p>Mix plenty of India ink the depth of color you require;
take a fine comb and brush; dip the brush in the
ink and pass it over the comb, thus splashing the ink all
over your material until it is quite black. Let it dry
thoroughly, and then unpin your flower; you will find its
form left in white on the velvet or linen. Mark, with a
fine brush, the veins and stems in it, and your work will
be ready to make up as required.</p>

<p>All delicate leaves should be carefully pressed till dry
before using them for this work.</p>


<h3>21.—PAPER PILLOW.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Save</span> all your scraps of writing paper, old notes of no
use, old envelopes, old backs of notes, &amp;c. Take a bag
or some box to throw them in, instead of the fire or rag-bag,
where they are usually placed. When a number
has been collected, cut them into strips about half an inch
wide or narrower, and two inches long; curl them wet
by drawing them over the blade of an old penknife.</p>

<p>Make a pillow case of any material you have; fill it
with your curled paper; mix with it a few shreds of old
flannel.</p>

<p>Stuff it <em>quite full</em>, sew the end up, and cover it as you
please. These pillows are invaluable in case of fevers,
as they keep cool, and are cheap and good substitutes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
for feather pillows. If these pillows are not required
for home use, our young ladies could make them for
our hospitals, or the poor.</p>


<h3>22.—IMITATION CARVED IVORY.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Take</span> half an ounce of isinglass, boiled gently in half
a pint of water, till dissolved; then strain it, and add
flake white, finely powdered, till it is as white as cream.</p>

<p>Take any article you desire to look like ivory, such as
a wooden box, stand, or card-case.</p>

<p>Give the article three or four coats of this solution,
letting each dry before the other is laid on; then smooth
it carefully with a bit of damp rag.</p>

<p>When the composition is perfectly dry, you can put on
the imitation carved ivory figures, which are made as
follows: Boil half a pound of best rice in one quart of
water, till the grains are soft enough to bruise into
a paste; when cold mix it with starch powder till you
make it as stiff as dough; roll it out about as thick as a
shilling. Cut it into pieces two inches square, and let it
dry before a moderate fire. These cakes will keep many
months, and be fit for use, if kept dry and free from
dust.</p>

<p>When required for use, get a coarse cloth, make it
thoroughly wet, then squeeze out the water and put it on
a large dish four times double; place the rice cakes in
rows between this damp cloth, and when sufficiently soft
to knead into the consistency of new bread, make it into
a small lump; if too wet, mix with it more starch powder,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
but it must be sufficiently kneaded to lose all appearance
of this powder before you take the impression; to do
which, you must procure some gutta percha half an inch
thick, cut it into pieces about two inches square, and
soften it in hot water; then get any real carved ivory
you can, and take off the impression on your pieces of
gutta percha, by pressing it carefully upon the carved
ivory till a deep impression is taken.</p>

<p>When the moulds are quite dry and hard, and your
paste in a proper state, with a camel’s hair brush lightly
touch with sweet oil the inside of the mould you are going
to use, and then press the rice paste into it; if the
impression is quite correct on removing it, take a thin,
sharp, small dinner knife and cut the paste smoothly,
just so as to leave all the impression perfect; then with
a sharp-pointed penknife smooth off all the rough edges,
and with white cement place your figures on the box in
large or small figures, just as your taste directs; the
figures adhere better if put on before they are quite dry.</p>

<p>Sometimes, from frequent kneading, the paste gets
discolored; these pieces should be set aside and used
separately, as they can be painted in water colors to
resemble tortoise shell or carved oak; this should be
done after being fastened to the box.</p>

<p>Having completed your work, finish by varnishing it
very carefully with ivory varnish, which should be almost
colorless.</p>

<p>This design so nearly resembles carved ivory, that it
has been mistaken for it when nicely done, and it is very
strong if carefully cemented.</p>

<p>Cover boxes simply with the flake white solution, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
then paint on them in water colors representations of
flowers, varnishing when dry with colorless varnish.
Such boxes are very easily made.</p>

<p>From the readiness with which the material can be
obtained, this is an elegant amusement for all who are
of an ingenious disposition.</p>


<h3>23.—DIAPHANIE, OR STAINED GLASS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> simple, but really beautiful invention, can easily
be acquired by carefully reading the following directions,
and by practice, the effect of gorgeous stained glass can
be given to common window glass, with moderate expense.
The materials required are plates of clear glass,
free from specks or bubbles, designs, groundings, and
borderings which are printed expressly for the purpose,
and in transparent colors; a roller which is employed to
press the paper closely on the glass, so as to remove the
bubbles of air; transfer varnish, to fasten the prints
upon the glass; clearing liquid, which is used after the
paper has been removed, to render the work transparent
and brilliant; the washable varnish, which protects the
designs from damps, and renders them capable of being
cleaned; and three camel’s hair brushes to apply the
varnish, &amp;c. There are three hundred sheets of designs
published for this work, consisting of subjects, borderings,
and groundings.</p>

<p>A window generally consists of parts of several sheets,
as it should contain a medallion or subject, a border, and
the whole of the remaining space filled up with grounding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
paper. Among some of the best subjects, we may mention
“The Virgin and Child.” “The four Evangelists
with architectural niches.” “The Adoration of the Magi,
with architectural borders.” “St. Peter and St. Paul.”
“The Annunciation.” “St. John the Baptist.” “St.
Joseph.” “Mater Admirabilis.” “Adoration of the
Magi.” “Boar hunt.” “Deer reposing.” “Two marine
views.” “The Laborer’s Return.” “Winter scenes,”
&amp;c. For these suitable groundings and borderings must
be selected according to the taste of the worker, who
must, however, remember that the beauty of the work
depends upon perfect harmony in coloring and design.</p>

<p>The materials being all collected, thoroughly cleanse
and dry your sheet of glass, and lay it flat upon a folded
cloth. Then cut out the medallion, or subject (unless
the paper is to be applied in one piece), and fasten it to
the glass by thoroughly damping it on the wrong side
with a wet sponge, giving it a plentiful coating of transfer
varnish on the printed side, laying it face downwards
upon the glass, and firmly pressing it down with the
roller, commencing at the centre, and gradually passing
over the edges.</p>

<p>The border must be the next fixed. Then damp the
printed side of the grounding paper, and lay it over;
raise one end of the glass, so that the light passing through
will enable you to see the position of the subject and border.
Trace round them carefully with a pencil, remove
the grounding paper, and cut it out a little within the
line, so that the ground may slightly overlap the subject;
give the coating of varnish, and apply it to the glass, as
before described, pressing it down with the roller, so that
no blisters are to be seen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>Take care to keep the back of the papers damp during
this operation, and when it is finished wash them
over with the sponge and water. It is well to interpose
a piece of damp paper between the roller and the design,
as this prevents the varnish adhering to it. The work
now requires to be left for four-and-twenty hours, so that
the varnish may become dry and hard; it is then ready
for the next operation—rubbing off the paper. This is
done by wetting and rubbing in a circular direction, with
a sponge or the hand.</p>

<p>After this the work again must be allowed to dry; after
which rub it with the hand so as to remove all loose
particles, and give it a coating of the clearing liquid,
which should be laid on with a flat brush. After again
remaining for a day to harden, the washable varnish is
applied, and the work is completed.</p>

<p>If these directions are carefully followed, a perfect
transparency will be produced, which it will require an
experienced eye to detect from real stained glass.</p>

<p>Transparencies in thin silk or muslin can be made by
tightly stretching the material on to a frame. The designs
are then subjected to two coatings of the clearing
liquid applied on the wrong side, and when dry, one of
the transfer varnish to the colored side. This is then
well pressed down by the roller. When quite dry, if the
picture appear at all cloudy, it will be necessary to apply
the clearing liquid again, then varnish, and the transparency
is finished. Be careful, however, not to remove
the work from the frame until perfectly dry. This work
is especially adapted for hall windows, by the side of the
front door, or in the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>We have seen beautiful specimens of this work done
by a twelve-year-old miss.</p>


<h3>24.—PAINTING ON GLASS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> of the works which profess to teach the art of
painting on glass, contain directions for staining large
windows in churches and halls; others merely give the
process of producing the more common paintings, such
as are carried about the streets for sale. These seem to
have been much in vogue about a century since, as all
the “Young Artists’ Assistants” of that day contain the
mode of painting them. They direct us to fix a mezzotinto
print upon the back of a sheet of glass, and to remove
the paper by wetting and rubbing, leaving the
impression of the print, which is afterwards to be painted
in broadwashes, the ink of the print giving the shadows.
The picture being then turned over, the glazed side becomes
the front, and the colors first laid on, are, of course,
nearest the eye. This mode of painting resembles the
style of Grecian painting, that being painted from the
back, and the shading is the ink of the engraving.</p>

<p>The methods by which glass is stained are scientific;
they require some knowledge of chemistry, and such
apparatus as must preclude the practice of this branch
of art as an amusement. It may be interesting, however,
to know something of the process. The glass being
at first colorless, a drawing is made upon it, and
the painting is laid on with mineral substances, the vehicle
being a volatile oil, which soon evaporates. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
sheets of glass are then exposed to a powerful heat, until
they are so far melted that they receive the colors into
their own substances. Enamel painting is done on the
same principle. This is a time of great anxiety to the
artist, as with all possible care valuable paintings, both
in glass and enamel, are frequently spoiled in the proving,
or vitrification. The art seems to have been lost
during several centuries; but it has of late been successfully
revived; and large windows have been executed for
churches and Gothic halls, which almost vie with the fine
old specimens in the cathedrals in point of color, while
they far excel them in other respects.</p>

<p>The branch of the art which may be treated as an
accomplishment, is the decoration of glass, flower-stands,
lamp-shades, and similar articles, with light and elegant
designs. Flowers, birds, butterflies, and pleasing landscapes
afford an extensive range of subjects, which are
suitable to this style of ornamental painting. The glasses
may be procured ready ground. The outline may be
sketched in with a black lead pencil; the lead can be
washed off with a sponge when the colors are dry. The
whole of the colors employed must be transparent, and
ground in oil; opaque, or body colors, will not answer
the purpose.</p>

<p>They may be purchased in small bladders, only requiring
to be tempered with fine copal or mastic varnish,
and a very little nut oil, to be ready for use. Blue is
produced by Prussian blue; red, by scarlet or crimson
lake; yellow, by yellow lake or gamboge; green, by verdigris,
or mineral green, or a mixture of Prussian blue
and gamboge; purple, by a mixture of lake and Prussian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
blue; reddish brown, by burnt sienna; and all the other
tints may be obtained by combinations; for white, or such
parts as are required to be transparent, without color,
the varnish only should be employed. A very chaste
and pleasing effect may be produced by painting the
whole design in varnish, without color.</p>

<p>It is an advantage to this style of painting that but
few colors are required; as from the nature of the subjects,
and their purpose as ornaments, brilliancy is more
desirable than a nice gradation of tints. The work must,
of course, be carefully dried, but may afterwards be
cleaned with a sponge and cold water.</p>


<h3>25.—PAINTING ON VELVET.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Painting</span> on velvet as well as on glass is an old art
revived. No art that is really beautiful in itself will
pass away entirely. As these paintings are very pleasing
to the eye, and easy of execution, it is well to know
how to paint them. The following directions are taken
from a reliable English work.</p>

<p>The colors for this style of painting are sold at the
drawing material warehouses in a liquid state, and prepared
for use. In addition to these, a brilliant rose-color
is obtained from the pink saucers, by dropping a little
weak gum water upon the color, and rubbing it with a
brush. A deep yellow may also be produced by pouring
a few drops of boiling water upon a small quantity of hay
saffron.</p>

<p>It is necessary to mix gum water with all the colors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
made, to prevent their spreading into each other; gum
dragon is the best for this purpose. The brushes used
are called scrubs; they consist of a small stick, with a
camel’s-hair brush cut off quite short at one end, and at
the other, a brush of bristles of a much harder description.
A small box of black lead is necessary, and a
piece of list rolled tightly round, to the diameter of about
two inches, to be used as a sort of brush with the black
lead, for making outlines in the manner we shall presently
direct. A piece of linen rag, to wipe the brushes on,
should also be provided.</p>

<p>The most brilliant flowers, fruits, shells, birds, &amp;c.,
are well adapted to this style of painting. The outline
of the subject may be sketched in pencil on the velvet,
which is of such a very delicate nature, that the greatest
nicety is necessary to keep it in a state of neatness. Care
should also be taken that the sketch is correctly made,
as an error cannot be effaced by rubbing out, as on paper.
It is a safer method, however, to make the sketch on
drawing-paper, and to prick the outline very closely with
a fine needle; then, the velvet being previously nailed
on a flat piece of wood of a proper size, the pricked pattern
may be laid over it, the roll of list dipped into the
black lead powder, and rubbed regularly over the pattern
from side to side; be careful to touch every part,
and on removing the pattern, a perfect outline in black
dots will appear on the velvet.</p>

<p>Where a set of articles of the same pattern is undertaken,
this is a very good plan, as it insures accuracy,
and saves the trouble of making separate sketches.</p>

<p>Even those who have no knowledge of drawing on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
paper, may produce a design on velvet with ease and
correctness, by tracing off against a window, or by means
of tracing paper, any drawing or print which they wish
to copy, and pricking the tracing on the velvet in the
manner just described. In order to keep the margin of
the velvet from being soiled in the progress of painting,
a piece of thick paper should be laid over the whole,
and an aperture cut in the middle, sufficiently large to
expose the part to be worked on. Each brush should
be kept for that color alone, to which it has once been
appropriated.</p>

<p>A small quantity of the color about to be used should
be poured into a little cup, and a drop of gum-water
added, and stirred with the stick of a pencil prior to its
being taken on the brush. The mode of its application
is so simple, that a short description of the execution of
a single flower will suffice to give an idea of the process
of painting almost any other subject on velvet. A very
small portion of color is to be taken upon the brush, and
the darkest part of the leaf touched with it; the brush
is then to be dipped in water, and the color gradually
softened to the edge; each leaf ought to be colored
separately, and the darkest parts in the centre of the
flowers may be finished with a small brush without softening.
India ink is used to make the dark shadows of
crimson flowers. The veins, and all the petals of flowers,
and all the fine lines, should be done with a pen.
Each leaf, as it is shadowed, should be brushed with the
hard end of a brush that way of the velvet in which the
pile runs most easily, and then in the contrary direction,
so as to set it up again to become dry. A deeper shade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
should never be added to a leaf or flower until the color
previously laid on is perfectly set, or the two colors will
spread, and run into each other; this will be prevented
by the gum, if sufficient time can be allowed for each
shade to dry before a subsequent one is applied.</p>

<p>When the piece is finished, and quite dry, it should be
brushed over with a small, round brush, about two inches
in diameter, with hard bristles of an equal length, to
raise up such parts of the pile as may have been flattened
in the process of painting.</p>

<p>Toilet sets, sofa cushions, fancy tables, pincushions, and
a variety of articles may be ornamented in this way.</p>


<h3>26.—CASTING IN PLASTER, SULPHUR, &amp;c.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Taking</span> the impression of coins, metals, &amp;c., is, independently
of its utility, a most interesting amusement.
This art is of considerable importance to collectors of
antique coins, &amp;c. It is often difficult and always expensive
to purchase superior specimens, of which, however,
exact models may be obtained by casting, without
the slightest injury to the originals. The mould is made
in the following manner:—</p>

<p>Take a strip of paper, a quarter or third of an inch
wide; roll it twice tight around the rim of the coin or
gem, of which a cast is intended to be taken, and fasten
the end with very stiff gum-water, which will hold it instantly.
Rub a very little oil, with a camel’s-hair pencil,
over the coin, in order to prevent the plaster from sticking;
then mix some fine plaster of Paris, with as much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
water as will make it almost as thick as treacle; apply
it quickly to the coin, on which it will be held by the
paper rim. It sets almost instantly, and may be taken
off in a few hours; but the longer it remains undisturbed
the better. The mould which is thus obtained is the reverse
of the coin; that is, the impression is concave, like a
seal. When the moulds are so dry that they will not wrinkle
a piece of paper laid flat upon the surface, let them
be well saturated with the best boiled linseed oil, placing
the moulds with their surface upward, that the whole
of the oil may be absorbed. They must be covered from
dust, and nothing should touch their surface, lest they
suffer injury. Moulds, well prepared in this manner,
and dried about two days after being oiled, will stand a
long time for the casting of either plaster or sulphur.
When used, either Florence oil or a little hog’s lard (the
latter to be preferred) should be applied very tenderly
over the mould with a little of the finest cotton wool, and
the cotton wool, without lard, afterwards passed lightly
over the surface, to leave as little as possible of the unctuous
matter upon the mould, that the casts may be the
finer. Put paper around them, as was before done to the
coin; pour on plaster in the same manner, and a facsimile
of the original will be produced.</p>

<p>Good casts may be made of sulphur, melted in an
iron ladle, either pure, or colored with a little red lead or
vermilion, powdered and stirred up with it. The moulds
and casts are made in the same manner as with plaster
of Paris, only that the sulphur must be poured on the
mould when hot, and water, instead of oil, must be used,
to prevent adhesion. Sulphur makes the best moulds for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
plaster casts, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versa</i>—as similar substances can
seldom be prevented, by either water or oil, from adhering,
in some degree, to each other. Plaster cannot be
used twice; that is, old or spoiled casts cannot be powdered
and again employed; for the moment the material
is moistened, being a species of lime, it is no longer
plaster without being reburnt.</p>

<p>Another way of making casts of almost any color,
is with a strong solution of isinglass; it must be used
when quite hot; and it is so thin that a box, exactly
fitting the rim of the coin, is required, otherwise it will
escape. It may be colored with saffron, wood, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Very beautiful impressions may be taken by pouring
melted wax upon the metal, which comes off easily when
the wax and metal are perfectly cold; but any one attempting
this had better try it first upon a penny, or
other coin of little value.</p>

<p>Impressions may also be taken in wax, which, for
this purpose, should be rendered pliable by kneading it
with the hand before the fire, a little oil having been previously
mixed with it. When softened to about the consistency
of putty, lay it and press it close down on the
coin, the form of which will then be perfectly obtained.</p>

<p>The following is another mode of taking impressions:
Procure tin or lead foil as thin as possible, place
it on the coin, and with a pin’s head, or any small,
smooth instrument, work it into every part; then take
it off, revert it into a shallow box, and pour plaster into
its concave side; a durable plaster cast is thus obtained,
covered with tin foil, which will resemble silver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>


<h3>27.—ENGRAVED BOXES.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> box should be white or light straw-color, in order
to show the faint impression to advantage. It should be
varnished five or six times in succession, and suffered to
dry thoroughly each time. While the last coat of varnish
is yet so fresh that your finger will adhere to it, the
engraving must be put on, the picture side next to the
varnish. The engraving must be prepared in the following
manner:—</p>

<p>All the white paper must be cut off close to the edges
of the engraving, which must be laid on a clean table,
with the picture downward, and moistened all over with
a clean sponge. It must then be placed between two
leaves of blotting paper, to dry it a little. Before putting
it on the box, take great care to have it even, and
determine exactly where you wish it to be. Lay one
edge of the print, picture downward, upon the varnish,
and gradually drop it to its place, passing the hand successively
over the back of the print in such a manner as
to drive out all the air, and prevent the formation of
blisters. Then carefully touch it all over with a linen
cloth, so as to be sure every part adheres to the varnish.
Leave it until it is thoroughly dry. Then moisten the
back of the engraving with a clean sponge, and rub it
lightly backward and forward with the fingers, so as to
remove the moistened paper in small rolls. When the
picture begins to appear, take great care lest you rub
through, and take off some of the impression. As soon
as you perceive there is danger of this, leave it to dry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
In drying, the engraving will disappear, because it is still
covered by a slight film of paper. You might think it
mere white paper; but give it a coat of varnish, and it
will become quite transparent. Should you by accident
have removed any part of the engraving, touch it with India
ink and gum-water, in order that no white spots may
appear; but when you put on your second coat of varnish,
you must take care to pass very lightly over the
spots you have retouched. The box should be varnished
as many as three times after the engraving has been
placed on it, and suffered to dry thoroughly each time.
The white alcoholic varnish is the best. It should be
put on in the sunshine, or near a warm stove. After the
last coat is well dried, sift a little pulverized rotten stone
through coarse muslin, and rub it on with linseed oil and
a soft rag; after being well rubbed, cleanse the box
thoroughly with an old silk handkerchief or soft linen
rag. Some persons say that a very thin sizing of nice
glue should be put on the box before it is varnished at
all; others say it is not necessary. This work requires
great patience and care; but the effect is very beautiful,
and pays for the trouble.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are very few games one person alone can play.
Mrs. Cheney has compiled a collection of these games,
under the name of “Patience,” which are very desirable.
These games are an acquisition to any home.
They amuse an invalid, and often act as a sedative to
men wearied of business cares, who desire some simple
amusement before sleeping. They do not produce the
feverish excitement of games of chance and skill played
against an opponent. Yet they can become a social
pleasure, by others looking on and sharing in the interest
of the game, and the pleasure of success. Boys and
girls would do well to learn them, as they will not divert
the mind from study, yet may help to pass pleasantly an
idle hour, besides exercising the <em>patience</em>. The publishers
have allowed us to give the directions of some of
the games; we also will add “The Army Solitaire,”
and when you play it, think of the pleasure it has given
to many a weary soldier, in diverting his mind from the
hardships of war. Our famous generals often played it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
the night before a battle, and if successful, looked upon
it as a good omen. We will add a few simple social
games.</p>


<h3>1.—THE LEGITIMIST.</h3>

<p class="center">TWO PACKS.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> name is of French origin, but it seems to have
no special adaptation to the game. It may have been applied
to it from some old royalist, who solaced his years
of exile with the company of mimic kings and queens.
It requires close attention, but is not otherwise difficult.</p>

<p>Take a king and place it at the left. Then, having
shuffled your cards well together, begin to lay them off.
You place in succession, in a horizontal row, next the
king, the queen, the knave, ten, nine, eight, seven, and
six, as they appear from the pack. On these you form
the families of thirteen cards each, piling downwards,
not following suit, and ending each family with the number
next to the bottom card, so that you will finish, if
successful, with a row of piles, whose top cards number
from the ace to the seven, inclusive. Put the cards that
you cannot immediately use in stock. You can take up
this stock, re-shuffle it, and re-lay it twice.</p>

<p>You must be very careful to observe when your families
are complete, for as each one ends with a different
number, you will be likely to put on too many cards if
you are inattentive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>


<h3>2.—THE SULTAN.</h3>

<p class="center">TWO PACKS.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 437px;">
<img src="images/i_163.jpg" width="437" height="600" alt="Card Layout" />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is, perhaps, the most curious and interesting of
all the games of Solitaire, and, if successful, it forms a
pretty picture of the sultan or king of hearts, surrounded
by his eight queens. As it is rather difficult to understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
the arrangement, we have prepared a little diagram
to illustrate it.</p>

<p>Take out the ace of hearts and all the kings. Place
one king of hearts in the centre. Just above him place
the ace of hearts, and below him the other king of
hearts. On each side of the ace place the kings of
clubs, who represent war. On each side of the first
king of hearts are the kings of diamonds, representing
the treasury; and on the lower line, each side of the
second king of hearts, are the kings of spades, representing
the industrial forces.</p>

<p>Then shuffle the remaining cards, and lay off from the
pack. Put the first four cards on one side off the square
formed by the kings, placing the ends of the cards towards
the square. Put the next four cards on the other
side in a similar manner; these eight cards form the
divan.</p>

<p>Leaving the sultan untouched, form the other families
by placing the aces on the kings, and so piling in regular
succession, according to suits, ending with the queens.
Place all cards which you cannot immediately use, in a
pile on the table, which is called the stock. You can use
the cards you are laying off from the packs, or the top
card of the stock, or any card in the divan, in forming
your families. When a card is taken from the divan,
you may fill its place, either by the top card from the
stock, or by the next card from the pack, as you think
most likely to be favorable to your purpose.</p>

<p>When you have exhausted the pack, you can take up
the stock and use it as a pack, always keeping your divan
full. This you can do twice. Some skill is required in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
placing the cards in the divan, and in selecting them for
use, and constant care is needed that no opportunity in
placing a card in the families escape you. You will, after
a little experience, generally be rewarded with success.</p>


<h3>3.—FRENCH SOLITAIRE.</h3>

<p class="center">ONE PACK.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> game is very simple, and well adapted to invalids
who cannot make much effort.</p>

<p>Shuffle the cards well. Lay the four aces as they
come in a row. Place the other cards as they appear
from the pack, on the aces in order, without following
suit; as, ace, deuce, three, four, &amp;c.; this is called putting
the cards in families.</p>

<p>Place the cards which do not fit on these, in due order
in four piles below, and whenever the top card will go on
the upper line, in regular sequence, you can use it, which
will thus free the card beneath it.</p>

<p>The skill consists in deciding on which of these four
piles to place the cards from the pack, and which card to
use, if you have two top cards of the same number.
Of course you must not, if you can help it, place a higher
card on a lower; but if you have already four piles, this
will often be unavoidable. You must then endeavor to
get off the higher cards, to free those beneath. According
to the old, strict rule, of not looking to see what
cards are beneath the top card, it becomes an excellent
exercise of memory to recall in which pile are the cards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
you want at the moment. It is not well to place many
cards of the same number in one pile. If you can complete
the families in the upper row to the kings, you have
succeeded in this game; if not, you have failed.</p>

<p>You may make this game still easier by taking out the
aces, and placing them in the upper row, before beginning
the game; or you may make it more difficult by
following suit in the families, in which case you are entitled
to take up the lower piles, re-shuffle them, and re-lay
them twice.</p>


<h3>4.—THE ARMY SOLITAIRE.</h3>

<p class="center">ONE PACK.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> army game is a decided favorite with all who
like solitaire games; we have never <em>seen</em> any printed
directions, yet there may be in some book we have not
had access to. We prefer it to any other game of solitaire,
and we hope these directions will be sufficiently
plain to interest our readers to try it.</p>

<p>Shuffle the cards thoroughly. Then deal off the first
card, whatever it may be, and place it on the upper corner
of the left hand side of an imaginary square. This
is called the foundation card, on which to form a family.
For instance, if it were the six of diamonds, the next
card to place upon it would be the seven of diamonds, as
the family must be formed in regular succession, according
to suit. Whenever you come across, in playing the
cards, the six of spades, hearts, or clubs, these are the
foundation cards (as the first card dealt gives the requisite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
value of the other three foundation cards, or as some
call them, the four towers of the fortress), and can be
placed in the other three corners, to form a square. On
these build your towers, as we directed in diamonds. If
you succeed in forming the four towers or families in
suit, and in succession, you have conquered.</p>

<p>When you deal a card that cannot be placed on the
corner families in succession, place it on the sides of the
square, between the foundation cards, as three of clubs,
and nine of spades, eight of diamonds, king of hearts,
and one can be placed in the centre of the square, as the
ace of diamonds; these five cards are called the reserve
forces, and on these you can place any card in downward
succession (suits need not be followed), which cannot
be used on the towers. For instance, if you deal off
the deuce of hearts, or any other deuce, place it on to
the three of clubs; or any eight, place it on to the nine
of spades; or king, place it on to the ace, so on; but
with every card turned, first look at your foundation
cards, or towers; never lose an opportunity to build up
these. All cards that cannot be played on to the four
towers or the five reserve cards, may be placed on one
side as stock.</p>

<p>Whenever any one of the five reserve corps cards are
vacant from being used to build up the towers, or a vacancy
made by being able to place reserve cards on the
other reserve corps, replace from the stock, and by taking
a card from the stock, a desirable card to use on the
towers may be freed.</p>

<p>The great skill of this game consists in the judicious
arrangement of the reserve corps; if you have two top<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
cards on different piles, of the same value, you should
carefully consider on which pile it is best to place the
card dealt of proper value, for future use.</p>

<p>If you can complete your towers in the first play,
without shuffling your stock, you have gained a great
victory; the stock can only be shuffled and played over
once. If the towers cannot then be built, the game can
be commenced anew. Sometimes the cards deal out so
perversely that even skilful play and patience cannot
build the towers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are many boys and girls who pride themselves
on their utter disregard of their personal appearance,
most fully comprehending the old phrase “that beauty
unadorned is adorned the most,” or perhaps think it a
mark of genius to appear so occupied with study as to
neglect their person. Such boys and girls are repulsive
to both God and man. One of the first laws Nature
teaches us, is perfect cleanliness. Look at the birds and
squirrels; indeed, all wild animals are taught by instinct
to take a daily bath, if possible. Tame animals are less
cleanly than wild ones in their habits, as far as our observation
goes. They look to man to cleanse them. But
God teaches the untamed beast and bird laws of cleanliness.
Look at the woods! God sends the rain to wash
them, and the winds to sweep them, and the sun to
brighten them. The Creator of all gives to every boy
and girl the mind to know how to take good care of their
own persons, and if they neglect the laws of health, just
so sure will come bodily suffering. Besides, it is a Christian
duty, as well as a social duty, of every boy and girl,
to make the most of all their personal attractions, and to
preserve every agreeable quality they may have been endowed
with, to the latest period of their lives. <em>It is not</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
<em>vanity</em>. It is a duty we all owe to ourselves, and we
owe it to others. Habits rightly formed in youth will
often prolong life, and add tenfold to any personal attraction.</p>

<p>We trust all boys and girls who read this book, will
not pass over this chapter on the toilet. We will try and
give them some useful hints and recipes.</p>

<p>In the first place, every boy and girl, no matter how
young, should strive to make their sleeping and dressing
apartment attractive. <em>Perfect neatness</em> is an <em>essential</em>
quality in every room. Never leave any article of clothing
on a chair, table, or floor, which can be either neatly
folded and placed in a drawer, trunk, or closet shelf, or
hung on some nail placed for that purpose. Never leave
a draw partly open. We once knew a young girl who
was always leaving her drawers open, and articles of
dress hanging from them. One Christmas, before a room
full of friends, she received from the Christmas tree a
little bureau, with every drawer partly open, and things
hanging out of each drawer. Of course it was soon
known to all <em>why</em> she received such a gift. That lesson
she <em>never</em> forgot. We must confess it also cured us of
the careless habit of leaving drawers partly open. We
hope our young friends will take this lesson to heart, and
profit by it.</p>

<p>When you rise in the morning, always (even if you
can afford plenty of servants), throw the clothes of your
bed carefully over the foot-board, or some chair, to give
your bed a sufficient chance to be well aired—a most
necessary requisite for health. Before leaving your room,
even in midwinter, open your window. Never allow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
your bed to be made till thoroughly aired. Though you
are not blessed with even a competency, you can make
a plain room attractive. A few pictures on the walls,
and by covering a plain pine toilet table with pretty,
cheap chintz, and exercising a little ingenuity in making
pretty articles of furniture out of old boxes. But always
be a foe to all dust; keep a dusting cloth at hand. After
washing, if you cannot have a chambermaid, arrange
your washing apparatus neatly, and carefully spread
your towels to dry, if clean. There are so few, comparatively,
in America, who can afford the constant attendance
of servants, we desire all boys and girls to learn
how to care for themselves.</p>


<h3>1.—THE BATH.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> olden times, in this country, baths were but little
used. It was considered a luxury but few could possess.
Now there is scarcely a decent house built without a bathroom.
In England and France, “there was a time when
many ladies had a most hydrophobiacal dread of water;
they thought it injured the delicacy of the complexion.
Their ablutions often consisted in wiping the cheeks with
a cambric handkerchief, dipped in elder flower or rose
water.”</p>

<p>A daily bath is now the rule rather than the exception,
and its effect is admirable. A cold bath, from sixty to
seventy degrees, is, to most persons, the most health-giving
and invigorating process one can undergo; but
beyond its invigoration, it is of no essential service in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
cleansing the skin. No one can preserve a purely clean
skin by the use of cold baths only, though the purifying
effect is increased by the use of rough towels, which help
to remove the impurities from the surface of the skin.
The skin is constantly throwing off fine dust like scales,
and these, blending with other foreign matter, stop up the
pores, and prevent the skin from performing its natural
functions.</p>

<p>Therefore soap should be used, because the alkali in it
assimilates with the oily exudations of the skin, and removes
impurities.</p>

<p>It has been said that soap is calculated to irritate the
skin, and injure the complexion. It is not true, according
to our knowledge. Some of the most beautiful complexions
we ever saw were washed with soap daily.
Great care should be taken that the soap is of a <em>good
quality</em>.</p>

<p>If any unpleasant sensations are experienced after its
use, it is easily removed by rinsing the skin with water
slightly acidulated with lemon-juice.</p>

<p>Once a week a warm bath, at about one hundred
degrees, should be used, with plenty of soap, to be sure
and cleanse the skin from all impurities. Sea-water
baths are invigorating, but not cleansing—a warm bath
is required after a short course of them. The same remark
applies to sea-salt baths, now much used. The
friction of coarse towels is very beneficial. Shower
baths are not generally desirable, as but few constitutions
can bear them.</p>

<p>Milk baths and perfumed baths are absurdities, which
a very few silly women indulge in; but nothing equals
pure salt water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>Of late years the practice of taking Turkish baths has
been introduced. Doubtless these baths are the best in
existence for a thorough cleansing of the pores of the
skin. But no one should venture to take them, except
after having first had medical advice, or those who possess
strong constitutions; for there are states of health
to which they would be injurious in the highest degree.
We consider them a great luxury.</p>

<p>We also recommend, most heartily, the sponge bath
for daily use. Use a large circular sponge.</p>

<p>It is always best, before taking any bath, to wet the
top of the head; boys and men can wet the sponge, and,
holding their heads over the bath-tub, thoroughly souse
their heads and necks. It prevents the blood rushing to
the head suddenly. A hair glove is excellent to rub the
body. Boys and men should exercise with the dumb-bells
after their morning bath; it increases their muscular
strength.</p>

<p>In all our directions with regard to the bath, it must
be borne in mind that we only refer to those who are in
a moderately sound state of health; otherwise their medical
attendant should be consulted. Sea-bathing is admirable
to all those who can bear it; but persons of a
bilious temperament, or with heart disease, and even
some with apparent health, may suffer serious ill consequences
from a single bath. Some constitutions cannot
bear the plunge into any cold water. All who have
a quick reaction from a sea-bath and cold water bathing
are benefited. The delicious glow it gives is most
charming. We have known many young, vigorous persons
suffer from sea-bathing; but it was their own fault,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
from remaining in the water too long; ten minutes is
sufficient.</p>


<h3>2.—COMPLEXION.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> will only give a few words of advice, as an assistance
in the preservation of the complexion.</p>

<p>Rise early, and go to bed early. Take a plenty of
exercise. Keep the pores of the skin open by perfect
cleanliness. Be moderate in eating and drinking. Do
not often frequent crowded assemblies, and <em>shun cosmetics,
and washes for the skin</em>. We will give a few harmless
recipes. But most of the powders and washes used
dry up the skin, and in the end make it rough.</p>

<p>Be careful always in washing to wipe your skin
dry, particularly your hands; rub them briskly for some
time. If hands are left moist after washing, they will
chap, crack, and become red. Honey is excellent to rub
over chapped hands, or anoint them with cold cream or
glycerine before retiring to rest.</p>

<p>If you desire to make your hands delicate, wash them
in hot milk and water for a day or two; on retiring to
rest rub them with palm oil, and put on gloves; wash them
well in the morning. Lime water, lemon-juice, or sour
milk will remove the sunburn from hands. Above all,
keep the nails scrupulously clean.</p>

<p>It is repulsive to see a lady or gentleman, however
well-dressed they may be, with nails in any degree shady.
We were once, in travelling, impressed with the beauty
of a young lady sitting near us. We spoke of her to a
young gentleman sitting by us. He exclaimed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span> “Look
at her hand! did you ever behold such a little black
row?” She had just drawn off her glove, and diamonds
glistened on her taper fingers; yet “that little black row”
cast a shade over her beauty.</p>

<p>The nails should be pared only once a week, after
washing, as the nail is then soft. Round them nicely
at the corners, and press the cuticle at the bottom of the
nail carefully down with the towel after washing. Never
bite your nails. It gives a stumpy appearance to the
nail. Also, never scrape the nail; it makes them
wrinkle.</p>

<p>Warts young people are sometimes troubled with; the
best cure is to purchase a stick of lunar caustic,—which
is sold in a case or holder,—dip the end in water, and
touch the wart twice a day; cut away the withered part
before applying the caustic a second time.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of freckles. “Cold freckles” are
constitutional, and we do not know of any remedy.
“Summer freckles” are caused by the winds and the
sunshine. The cause assigned for this is, that the iron in
the blood, forming a junction with the oxygen, leaves a
rusty mark where the junction takes place. The obvious
cure is to dissolve the combination. We have had given
to us several recipes which are said to be excellent. We
will give the best of them.</p>


<h3>3.—RECIPE TO CURE FRECKLES.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Into</span> half a pint of milk squeeze the juice of a lemon,
with a spoonful of brandy, and boil, skimming well; add
a dram of rock alum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>


<h3>4.—A CURE FOR FRECKLES.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Scrape</span> horse-radish into a cup of cold sour milk;
let it stand twelve hours, strain, and apply two or three
times a day.</p>


<h3>5.—A CURE FOR FRECKLES.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Mix</span> lemon juice, one ounce; powdered borax one
quarter dram; sugar, half a dram; keep a few days in a
glass bottle, then apply occasionally.</p>


<h3>6.—A CURE FOR PIMPLES.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Many</span> of our young people are much troubled with an
eruption upon the face. It often proves a great annoyance
to them; but there is a simple remedy, which, if it
does not effect a complete cure, will obviate the trouble
in a great degree, without the least injury to the health
or skin.</p>

<p>To one grain of corrosive sublimate add one ounce of
rose water; filter, and apply twice a day.</p>


<h3>7.—HAIR.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is impossible for a lady to possess anything that so
adds to her charms as a good head of hair. “It is a
crown of beauty.” This accounts for the enormous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
amount of advertisements of infallible hair tonics and
restorers. Beware of such advertisements. We will
give you some few simple and most essential rules to
preserve the hair. Also some recipes (easily and cheaply
made) of the most excellent pomatums. The skin of the
head is delicate, therefore especial care should be taken
in brushing the hair, and in keeping the scalp as clean as
possible. The brush should be of moderate hardness.
The hair should be separated, in order that the head itself
may be well brushed, as by so doing the scurf or loose
skin will be removed; if suffered to remain it becomes
saturated with perspiration, and weakens the roots of
the hair, causing it to fall off. To retain a beautiful
head of hair, it ought to be brushed twenty minutes in the
morning, and ten minutes when dressed in the middle of
the day, and a like period at night. In brushing or
combing it, begin at the extreme points; and in combing,
hold the portion of hair just above that through which
the comb is passing firmly, so that if it is entangled, it
may drag from that point, and not from the roots. We
have known the finest heads of hair ruined by careless
combing and breaking the hair.</p>

<p>It depends upon the nature of the hair whether pomatum
is required. Those whose hair is naturally oily and
glossy need nothing to make it so; but dry hair requires
it. Pure salad oil, scented, is excellent, and bear’s grease.
An excellent pomade is made of beef’s marrow, after it
is clarified; take six tablespoons of the marrow, heated,
and six tablespoons of scented castor oil, to one tablespoonful
of brandy or rum. Stir these ingredients half
an hour, until it is beaten to a cream; then place it in
your jars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>


<h3>8.—CARROT POMADE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is another excellent recipe. Two thirds beef’s
marrow, one third leaf lard unsalted, one carrot grated
fine, simmered together for two or three hours.</p>

<p>These pomades should be applied with the hand or a
soft brush, and rubbed into the hair thoroughly. Be
careful and not oil the hair often, for an over oiled head
is offensive. It is well to rub the hair at night with a
piece of flannel, so that the oil used in the day may be
removed. Every month the hair should be shampooed.
A few drops of ammonia in rain water will cleanse it
well; put the whole hair into the solution, and wash it;
then cleanse it with clear milk-warm water, and clip all
the ends of the hair without fail. Every split end will,
if not cut off, deaden the hair. Another good cleansing
recipe is, one ounce of powdered borax, a small bit of
camphor, dissolved in a quart of boiling water. With
any recipe for cleansing, the hair must be rinsed thoroughly
with clear spring water. All boys and gentlemen
should wash their heads all over, hair and all, every
morning, and wear ventilated hats. Gentlemen become
bald sooner than ladies from wearing close hats so much.</p>


<h3>9.—BANDOLINE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">A French</span> recipe, is excellent—because it is harmless—to
use in dressing hair to keep back any refractory
locks.</p>

<p><i>Recipe.</i> Simmer one ounce of quince seed in a quart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
of water, forty minutes; strain cool, add a few drops of
scent, and bottle, corking tightly.</p>

<p>Another way of making “Bandoline” is with Iceland
moss. Take a quarter of an ounce, boiled in a quart of
water, and a little rectified spirits added, so that it may
keep.</p>

<p>A weak solution of isinglass is the only curling fluid
that is harmless.</p>


<h3>10.—COLD CREAM.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Is</span> excellent for a lip salve. The recipe is a pint of
sweet oil, half an ounce of spermaceti, and two ounces
of white wax, melted together over the fire and scented;
or take a pint of oil of sweet almonds, one ounce of white
wax, half an ounce of spermaceti, and half a pint of rose
water, beat to a paste.</p>


<h3>11.—RECIPE FOR CAMPHOR ICE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Half</span> a cake of white wax, a good inch of a pure
spermaceti candle, a piece of camphor as large as an
English walnut, a tablespoonful of sweet oil, mix and
simmer all together; if too soft, add more wax, if too
hard, add more oil. This is excellent to use in cold
weather for lips and hands.</p>

<p>This being prepared for a home book, we give a few
recipes for the use of the toilet, which we know are
good.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>We will give one more most excellent recipe for a
cooling and healing salve.</p>


<h3>12.—CUCUMBER SALVE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Half</span> a pound of pure lard unsalted, a heaping quart
cup of cucumbers sliced as for eating; let them simmer
an hour, so as not to boil, then strain into cups.</p>


<h3>13.—TO LOOSEN STOPPERS OF TOILET
BOTTLES.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Let</span> a drop of pure oil flow round the stopper, and
stand the bottle near the fire. After a time tap the
stopper with the handle of a hair brush; if this is not
effectual, use a fresh drop of oil, and repeat the process.</p>


<h3>14.—TO REMOVE A TIGHT RING.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> a ring happens to get tightly fixed on a finger,
take a piece of common twine, soap it thoroughly, and
then wind it round the finger as tightly as possible. The
twine should commence at the point of the finger, and be
continued till the ring is reached; the end of the twine
must then be forced through the ring. If the string is
then unwound, the ring is almost sure to come off the
finger with it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>


<h3>15.—HAIR WASH.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> much borax as a pint of hot water will absorb,
three tablespoonfuls of best olive oil, twenty drops of
almond essential oil. This recipe we recommend most
heartily. It must be well shaken before using.</p>


<h3>16.—A CURE FOR POISON.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Sweet</span> oil is a cure for the poisonous bite of serpents,
spiders, &amp;c.; also for being poisoned by ivy and dogwood.
Bathe the part bitten or affected, and take a
teaspoonful internally. If a horse is affected, it will require
eight times as much to affect him. All persons
sensitive to poison whenever they visit the woods, on
their return should wash hands and face in vinegar and
salt, and take camphor inwardly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> subject of reading cannot be omitted in a work
devoted to the interests of the home. Books have such
a large share in developing and sustaining the home life,
that their influence can hardly be exaggerated. At the
same time it is not possible, in a comprehensive work like
this, to treat of the subject as its importance demands.
We can only throw out a few general hints, which may
be suggestive to some.</p>

<p>In the first place, we would say to all young persons
into whose hands this book may come, <em>read something
daily</em>. And by this we mean, not the careless looking
through a novel for the amusement of a leisure hour,
but the faithful, thorough mastery of another’s thought.
It is of less consequence that that thought should be new,
or specially valuable, than that the habit should be formed
of intelligent reading. A poor book well read will usually
teach a young person more than a good one read
carelessly. We are not saying, let it be understood, that a
book should always be read from beginning to end; there
is a habit of quick perception of the general tone and
value of a book, which, to a student in search of facts
for special use, is of the greatest assistance; but this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
comes later. The power of attention and concentration
should first be gained. And for this purpose, secondly,
it is important that you should <em>form an opinion of what
you have read</em>. Never lay aside a book until you can
state intelligibly the author’s purpose and meaning in it,
and how far, as it appears to you, that purpose has been
attained. It is an excellent plan to write a short abstract
of the plot of a story, or the facts of a biography;
but whether this is done or not, do not be contented to let
what you have read pass through the mind like water
through a sieve. Compel everything to yield you some
tribute of suggestion, if not of direct instruction. Do
not be satisfied with anything less than a definite opinion;
if you are in the wrong, the correction of a maturer mind
will help you to judge more truly the next time.</p>

<p><em>Do not confine yourself to one kind of reading.</em> If you
are fond of novels, that is no reason why you should read
them exclusively. Perhaps acquaintance with a different
class of books may develop a taste for them; at anyrate
you cannot afford to read entirely for amusement.
It is neither our province nor our wish to condemn novel-reading;
the excessive practice of it will, we believe, be
best checked by acquaintance with books of greater
value. There are histories as varied in incident as any
novel. There are books of travel which combine the
romance of adventure with the instruction of facts.
There is poetry in all its forms, without some knowledge
of whose best examples your education cannot be considered
even passable. The fact is rather that there is
so much of each class, which a cultivated person is expected
to be familiar with, that the great difficulty is in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
selection. In order that you may divide your time profitably
among these different studies, it is well to take the
advice of some competent person as to <em>what is the best
book for your purpose on a given subject</em>. In this manner
you will save much time and patience, while if you take
up the first book on the topic in question which comes to
hand, you may, by an injudicious choice, lose your interest
in the whole matter. On any historical question, for
instance, it is better to read at first an author who gives
a concise and general view of the events of the period,
and afterwards those entering more minutely into details.
It is well, too, before intrusting yourself to the guidance
of any historian, to ascertain the estimation in which he
is held by competent critics, that you may thus understand
how to separate the truth from exaggeration and
special pleading.</p>

<p><em>Have several kinds of reading for every day.</em> Do not
give yourself up entirely to one class of books at a time,
or you will either tire of them, or your judgment will become
confused in regard to them. It is well to have
some book of history, or travels, or metaphysics, another
on religious subjects, and a third for entertainment simply—a
<em>good</em> novel, if possible.</p>

<p>In this way much more knowledge is gained without
fatigue, than when the mind is kept exclusively to one
theme.</p>

<p><em>Committing to memory a few lines every day</em>, is a habit
which cannot be too strongly urged. It need not be
made a tedious matter, by giving up one’s whole time
and attention to it as a study; it can best be done when
walking, or sewing, or engaged in household work, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
will become, after a little, a pleasure instead of a task.
Besides the daily acquisition of something worth remembering,
there will be gained also a power quite as valuable,
of observing the characteristics and style of various authors,
the delicate differences of words, and the construction
of sentences. It may safely be said that those
writers who have been most celebrated for beauty and
perspicuity of style, have owed this, in no small degree, to
the early habit of committing to memory the works of
the best authors.</p>

<p>In conclusion, we would beg our young readers to
make friends of books. They will cheer many an hour
that would otherwise be lonely; they are kind, ever
ready, yet unobtrusive comforters in perplexity or sorrow;
they represent that which is best and truest in all
ages, and are the highest expression of itself, of which
humanity is capable.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> cannot leave this book without giving a few
simple rules for nursing the sick. Most of our young
people, and many old, are ignorant of the commonest
principles.</p>

<p>Never wear a rustling dress or creaking shoes in waiting
on the sick. Be careful not to shake the bed, or fidget
near it, so as to touch, disturb, and needlessly fatigue the
invalid. Few noises are more irritating in sickness than
noise from the grate. The startling effect of putting on
coals may destroy the effect of an opiate. It is better to
put them on one by one. In voice and manner be <em>gentle</em>,
and in spirit <em>cheerful</em> and <em>hopeful</em>. Do not depress by
tears, but control looks, words, and actions. Say nothing
in the room, or even outside the door, which you would
not wish the sick to hear. Ask questions but rarely, and
never occasion a needless effort to gratify your own curiosity.
In giving nourishment with a spoon, be careful
to raise the bowl of the spoon so as not to drop anything,
or annoy the sick person by untidy feeding. Be sure to
have cups, spoons, and glasses clean. Make everything
as attractive as you can from the nicety and freshness
of the dish. Do not allow jellies or rejected dainties to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
remain in the room. The time may come to any boy or
girl when they may desire to watch by a sick bed of a
parent or friend, and the above rules may assist them.</p>

<p>If the sick person should take a dislike to you, be not
disheartened at it; but if possible resign your place by
the bedside. It may be that you were clumsy, and awkward,
or over-anxious. It may be only one of those unaccountable
fancies which sometimes takes possession of
the sufferer, and which it is our duty to treat with care
and consideration.</p>


<h3>1.—COOKING FOR THE SICK.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Beef tea.</span> Take one pound of beef, without any fat,
cut it in very small pieces, and put it in a bottle; cork it
and put it into a kettle of water, and boil it until the
juice is exhausted; this will do for very sick people who
can only take a teaspoonful of nourishment at one time.
Take a pound of lean beef, cut it up fine in a quart of
cold water, let it boil an hour, then salt it, and put in a
pinch of cayenne pepper, strain it, and it is ready for
use. This given to a person troubled with sleeplessness
(from general debility), about a half cup full just before
retiring, will generally enable the patient to sleep.</p>


<h3>2.—PORT WINE JELLY.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Take</span> a half pint of port wine, one ounce of isinglass,
one ounce of gum arabic, one ounce of loaf sugar; let it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
simmer for a quarter of an hour, stirring it till the gum
and isinglass are dissolved, then pour it into a mould.
When cold it will be quite stiff.</p>


<h3>3.—TOAST WATER.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Brown</span> thoroughly, but not burn to a cinder, a small
slice of bread; put it into a pitcher, and pour over it a
quart of water which has been boiled and cooled; after
two hours pour off the water; a small piece of orange or
lemon peel put into the pitcher with the bread improves it.</p>


<h3>4.—TO PREPARE RENNET WHEY.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Get</span> a rennet, such as is used for cheeses. Then take
a piece two inches square, or a little larger, rinse it
first in cold water, then pour on to it two table-spoonfuls
of hot water, and let it stand a half hour in a warm
place. Take three pints of milk, and heat it blood warm.
Then pour in both the rennet and water, and stir it in
well. Cover and let it stand in a warm place, to keep
the milk of an even temperature; it must not be moved
until it turns to a curd; then cut up the curd with a spoon
and strain it, and boil up the whey once. It is then ready
for use. If in an hour it does not turn to a curd, take
out the rennet, and put in some more freshly prepared.
It will then surely curd.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>


<h3>5.—FLAX-SEED SIRUP.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> we know to be an excellent remedy for a cough.
Boil one ounce of flax-seed in a quart of water for half
an hour; strain, and add to the liquid the juice of two
lemons and half a pound of rock candy. If there is a
soreness and general weakness from the cough, add half
an ounce of powdered gum arabic.</p>


<h3>6.—MUCILAGE OF SAGO.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Take</span> an ounce or a table-spoonful of sago, steep in a
pint of water, in a pan placed on the back of the stove
for two hours, then boil for fifteen minutes, stirring it all
the time. This mucilage can be sweetened with sugar
and flavored with lemon juice, or milk can be added.</p>


<h3>7.—APPLICATIONS FOR THE SICK.—REFRESHING
LOTION.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Mix</span> one table-spoonful of vinegar, one of eau de
cologne, and one of water. Dip a linen rag or a handkerchief
into this preparation and lay upon the head. It
refreshes a patient.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>


<h3>8.—RECEIPT FOR CROUP.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> tea-spoonful of powdered alum mixed with molasses
or lard, and sometimes water; make a child with
croup swallow it; it is a quick emetic.</p>


<h3>9.—REMEDY FOR SORE THROAT.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Take</span> a tea-spoonful of chlorate of potassium and dissolve
in a tumbler of hot water, and gargle the throat
every two hours.</p>


<h3>10.—BURNS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Dissolve</span> alum in water, and bottle ready for use; or
common lime-water; either remedy applied at once will
relieve a burn and draw out the fire. Pour the solution
into a bowl, and hold the burnt place, if possible, into it,
or wet cloths with it. Sweet oil and laudanum can be
added to the lime-water.</p>

<p>We simply give a few remarks for ordinary troubles,
which may be useful; but we cannot leave this article
without giving some useful rules for making <em>good bread</em>,
which few make, and every young girl should learn how
to do, as good bread is essential to the health of every
household. An experienced housekeeper has kindly prepared
for us the following article.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
</div>

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>




<h2><span class="gesperrt"><a name="Directions_for_making_Bread_Yeast_c" id="Directions_for_making_Bread_Yeast_c"></a>Directions for making Bread, Yeast &amp;c.</span></h2>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/i_h_rule.jpg" width="150" height="19" alt="horizontal rule" />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Holy Writ</span> assures us that bread is the staff of life,
and experience fully proves the assertion. Yet many of
us know not how to make this needed support. Every
girl, no matter what her station in life may be, should
learn how to prepare it in its <em>highest excellence</em>.</p>

<p>The word <em>bread</em> is derived from brayed grain, from
the verb to bray, or pound; indicative of the method of
preparing the flour.</p>

<p>Dough comes from the Anglo-Saxon word <i>deawian</i>, to
wet or moisten. Loaf is from the Anglo-Saxon <i>lif-ian</i>,
to raise or lift up, as raised bread. Leaven is derived
from the French verb <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lever</i>, to raise.</p>

<p>Dwellers in country towns and villages are forced to
prepare the leaven, or yeast; so we append a receipt
which never fails to make good bread. Wash and pare
six good-sized, white-fleshed potatoes, grate them raw,
on a lemon grater. Pour over them three quarts of
boiling water; it will thicken up like starch. Add one
table-spoonful of salt and half a cup of sugar. When
the mixture is lukewarm, pour in one cupful of yeast.
Set the pan beside the stove, and in six hours it will be
light enough to use. Let it stand over night in a cool
place; next morning cork it tightly in a jug. Keep it in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
the cellar or ice-house; but be sure that it does not
freeze—that kills the life of it. Home-made yeast requires
double the quantity of baker’s yeast. One teacupful
of this yeast will make three loaves of bread and
a pan of biscuit.</p>

<p>Potatoes added to the bread increases its bulk and
quality. Boil six common-sized potatoes in two quarts
of water, with one table-spoon of salt. When perfectly
salt, mash fine on a plate, leaving no little particles.
They can be rubbed through a colander and reduced to a
pulp; turn it into the bread-pan, and pour over the water
in which they were boiled. Sift eight quarts of flour,
and when the potato-water is cooled, so as to be a little
warm to the touch, stir in half the flour; then add one
teacupful of the yeast. When that is thoroughly mixed
up, put in the rest of the flour, making it thick enough to
knead stiffly. Do this in the evening, and place the pan
in a warm room in winter, a cool one in summer. Early
next morning it will be risen finely. Another pan should
have been tightly covered over it, and it will rise up into
the pan. Knead it thoroughly on the moulding board,
chopping it with a chopping-knife, or pounding with a
pestle. Bread must be kneaded for an hour at least, if
one desires the best quality. Holes in the slices of bread
show that it was not well made. The superiority of the
French bread-makers is owing to this cause. In many
bakeries the dough is prepared by machinery. After the
process of kneading is finished, rolls can be made, and
baked for breakfast. They are prepared by rolling the
dough in the shape of a rolling-pin, then cutting off a
small portion, and rolling that in the same shape. Dip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
the sides and tops in melted butter, place in a pan, and
put them in a warm place for twenty minutes; then bake
in a hot oven twenty minutes. The melted butter causes
them to break apart perfectly, and to brown handsomely.</p>

<p>The remainder of the dough is placed near the stove to
rise a second time. It must be closely watched—<em>ten
minutes’ neglect will sour it</em>.</p>

<p>To be sure a teaspoonful of saleratus will sweeten it;
dissolve it in warm water, and mix it in so there will be
no yellow spots; but, if used, it takes away the fresh
sweetness of the bread. Making bread is not like cake
or pie-making—<em>it demands close attention</em>; will not be
neglected without injury. It requires some brains to
make good bread, and that is one reason why so many
families rarely know what the best quality of bread is.
If it sours, turn in the saleratus; if it is half-kneaded,
and half-risen, and the oven is ready, why, bake it, and
thus very poor bread is the result! Bread cannot be set
aside for dish-washing or sweeping. It must be of the
<em>first consequence</em>.</p>

<p>When it is risen for a second time, and blubbers appear,
flour your moulding-board, turn out the dough, cut
it into as many parts as you desire loaves of bread, and
knead, pound, or cut each loaf <em>well</em>; then have your
bread-pans buttered, and put in the dough, kneading it
into the corners of the pan. Prick it all over with a
fork, place near the stove for fifteen or twenty minutes,
or until it has filled the pans to the brim. Have your
oven so hot, that if a sprinkling of flour is thrown in, it
will brown quickly, but not burn; then set in the pans.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
Three quarters of an hour, in a properly heated oven,
will bake bread. Don’t burn your crusts, but watch the
oven, and in twenty minutes after putting them in, look
at them and turn the pans round, for usually one side of
an oven bakes the fastest. When it is baked, take it
from the pans directly, else the sides will become moistened
and clammy. Spread a clean towel on the table or
shelves, and stand the bread on it. If the crust is too
thick and brown, wrap the loaves in a clean towel wet
with cold water; this softens it.</p>

<p>If these directions are closely followed, and a good
brand of flour is used, no girl can fail to make A No. 1
bread.</p>

<p>No lady can teach her servants unless she has learned
the alphabet of cookery herself, and bread may be called
the A B C’s of the kitchen.</p>


<h3>1.—WAFFLES.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Take</span> one quart of milk; melt in the milk a large
spoonful of butter; beat up four eggs, and add to this
mixture a little salt; add to the slightly warm milk a
small gill of yeast, flour sufficient to make a batter just
right for a waffle iron, or a little thinner to bake on a
griddle iron. The batter for waffles is also nice baked in
tins as muffins. Some elder person can direct, the first
time you make this recipe, the proper thickness of the
batter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>


<h3>2.—A CREAM TOMATO SOUP.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Twelve</span> tomatoes, skinned and cut up, cook thirty
minutes (or a quart of canned tomatoes, ten minutes will
cook it). When cooked, stir in quarter of a teaspoonful
of soda; when done foaming put in two large crackers,
rolled fine; one quart of milk, salt and pepper to taste;
stir in a piece of butter nearly the size of an egg; let it
all boil up once, then serve for dinner.</p>


<h3>3.—BREAKFAST CAKE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Three</span> table-spoonsful of sugar, two of butter, two
eggs, one teaspoon of soda dissolved in a cup of milk,
two teaspoons of cream of tartar mixed into a pint of
wheat flour, beat well and bake quickly.</p>


<h3>4.—MOLASSES GINGERBREAD.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Three</span> cups of flour, two of molasses, one of boiling
water; dissolve in this, butter the size of an egg, half
a teaspoonful of soda, dissolved in a little hot water, one
large spoonful of ginger, and one of cinnamon. Bake
in bread tins until done, which can be ascertained by
pricking it with a broom corn; if none of the gingerbread
adheres to the stick, it is done. This is the way
to ascertain if any kind of cake is done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>


<h3>5.—PLAIN COOKIES.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> cup of molasses, one half a cup of milk (sour if
possible), dissolve a teaspoonful of soda in the milk.
One table-spoonful of butter, flour sufficient to make it
stiff to roll out and cut in any shape desired.</p>


<h3>6.—MOONSHINE CRACKERS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> quart of flour, one table-spoonful of butter, a teaspoonful
of salt, rub these into the flour and turn it on
to the moulding board; turn into it a small tumbler of
ice-water; knead the water in little by little. Then
pound it with the rolling pin fifteen minutes, roll as thin
as possible, and cut out as you do cookies; round cutters
are the best for crackers; mark with a jagging iron, and
bake ten minutes.</p>


<h3>7.—NEW YEAR’S COOKIES.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Rub</span> three quarters of a pound of butter into a pound
of flour. Take a half pint of boiling water and pour
over a pound and a half of light brown sugar in a bowl;
dissolve a small teaspoonful of soda in two large spoons
of hot water. Add flour <em>only</em> sufficient to roll out very
thin; cut it out in oblong shapes with a jagging iron;
bake <em>quickly in a hot oven</em>. In New York they mark
these cakes with mottos,—Christmas and New Year’s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>


<h3>8.—SPONGE CAKE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Two</span> cups of fine-powdered sugar, two cups of flour,
six eggs, one large lemon, or one and a half of small
size; beat the yolks of the eggs and the sugar and
grated peel of the lemon together; beat the whites separately,
and stir into the sugar, &amp;c., with the flour; this
makes one good-sized loaf, or two small ones; be careful
and not have too hot an oven.</p>


<h3>9.—LOAF CAKE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Two</span> cups of light wheat dough, one of sugar, half a
cup of butter, two eggs, half a teaspoonful of soda, one
grated nutmeg, two teaspoonfuls of ground cloves, two
of cinnamon; stoned raisins can be added, half a cupful;
mix all together. This makes one loaf.</p>

<p>Neatness is essential in cooking. Wash your hands
often. Baking badly spoils the best of cake and bread.
Learn of an experienced person the proper degree of
heat.</p>

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
